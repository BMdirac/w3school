           <!--   CHAPTER 1  ************************************************************************************************** --> 

    < a href=""> </a>
    here "a" is called a tag while "href" is called an attribute (anything in position of href here is called attribute)
    attributes are found in a tag

    <p> How are you </p>
    Here "How are you" is called element

    (1) NOTE THE FOLLOWING
Use the "style" attribute for styling HTML elements
Use "background-color" for background color
Use "color" for text colors
Use "font-family" for text fonts
Use "font-size" for text sizes
Use "text-align" for text alignment

    (2)  HTML Formatting Elements
<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

    NOTE: 3 to 8 are all quotation in html

    (3) HTML <blockquote> for Quotations
The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.

Example
<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
The world's leading conservation organization,
WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
1.2 million members in the United States and
close to 5 million globally.   
</blockquote>

    (4) HTML <q> for Short Quotations
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

Example
<p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>

    (5) HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations
The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.  

Example
<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>

    (6) HTML <address> for Contact Information
The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.

The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.

The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

Example
<address>
Written by John Doe.<br>
Visit us at:<br>
Example.com<br>
Box 564, Disneyland<br>
USA
</address>

    (7) HTML <cite> for Work Title
The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).

Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.

The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.

Example
<p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>

    (8) HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override
BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.

The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:

Example
<bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo>

    (9) COLORS IN HTML
HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values

(a) Background Color
You can set the background color for HTML elements:

Example
<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;">Lorem ipsum...</p>

(b) Text Color                                  
You can set the color of text:

Example
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>                  
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Lorem ipsum...</p>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Ut wisi enim...</p>

(c) Border Color
You can set the color of borders:

Example
<h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">Hello World</h1>

    (10) Internal CSS
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

    (11) CSS (Cascading stylesheet)
(a) Colors, Fonts and Sizes
The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.

The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.

The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.

(b) CSS Border
The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.

Tip: You can define a border for nearly all HTML elements.

(c) CSS Padding
The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.

(d) CSS Margin
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.

    (12) Link to External CSS
External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
(a) Example
This example uses a full URL to link to a style sheet:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css">

(b) Example
This example links to a style sheet located in the html folder on the current web site: 

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/html/styles.css">

(c) Example
This example links to a style sheet located in the same folder as the current page:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

    (13) HTML Links
(a) HTML Links - Syntax
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

    Example
This example shows how to create a link to W3Schools.com:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>

(b) HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

Example
Use target="_blank" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>

(c) Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

Example
<h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

<h2>Relative URLs</h2>
<p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
<p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>

(d) Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

Example
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

(e) Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:

Example
<button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>

(f) Link Titles
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a>

(g) More on Absolute URLs and Relative URLs
Example
Use a full URL to link to a web page: 

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

Example
Link to a page located in the html folder on the current web site: 

<a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

Example
Link to a page located in the same folder as the current page: 

<a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

    (14) HTML Link Colors
(a) By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
You can change the link state colors, by using CSS:

Example
Here, an unvisited link will be green with no underline. A visited link will be pink with no underline. An active link will be yellow and underlined. In addition, when mousing over a link (a:hover) it will become red and underlined:

<style>
a:link {
  color: green;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
  color: pink;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  color: red;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:active {
  color: yellow;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
</style>

(b) Link Buttons
A link can also be styled as a button, by using CSS:

Example
<style>
a:link, a:visited {
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 25px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
}

a:hover, a:active {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>

    (15) HTML Links - Create Bookmarks
HTML links can be used to create bookmarks, so that readers can jump to specific parts of a web page.

Create a Bookmark in HTML
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.

To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it.

When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark.

Example
First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark:

<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:

Example
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
You can also add a link to a bookmark on another page:

<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

Chapter Summary
Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark

    (16) Common Image Formats
Here are the most common image file types, which are supported in all browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera):

Abbreviation	File Format	                            File Extension
APNG	        Animated Portable Network Graphics	        .apng
GIF	            Graphics Interchange Format	                .gif
ICO            	Microsoft Icon	                            .ico, .cur
JPEG	        Joint Photographic Expert Group image	    .jpg, .jpeg, .jfif, .pjpeg, .pjp
PNG         	Portable Network Graphics	                 .png
SVG	            Scalable Vector Graphics	                .svg

Chapter Summary
Use the HTML <img> element to define an image
Use the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image
Use the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
Use the HTML width and height attributes or the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the left or to the right


                 <!--   CHAPTER 2  ************************************************************************************************** --> 

    (17) HTML IMAGES

(a) HTML Background Images 
(i) Background Image on a HTML element
To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property:

Example
Add a background image on a HTML element:

<p style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">
You can also specify the background image in the <style> element, in the <head> section:

Example
Specify the background image in the <style> element:

<style>
p {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>

(ii) Background Image on a Page
If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the <body> element:

Example
Add a background image for the entire page:

<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>

(iii) Background Repeat
If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element:

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>
To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
</style>

(iv) Background Cover
If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.

Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:

This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: cover;
}
</style>
Background Stretch
If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%:

Try resizing the browser window, and you will see that the image will stretch, but always cover the entire element.

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: 100% 100%;
}
</style>

(b) HTML <picture> Element
The HTML <picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes.

(i) The HTML <picture> Element
The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.

The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.

Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.

Example
Show different images for different screen sizes:

<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
  <img src="img_girl.jpg">
</picture>

Note: Always specify an <img> element as the last child element of the <picture> element. The <img> element is used by browsers that do not support the <picture> element, or if none of the <source> tags match.

(ii) When to use the Picture Element
There are two main purposes for the <picture> element:

1. Bandwidth
If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.

2. Format Support
Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements.

Example
The browser will use the first image format it recognizes:

<picture>
  <source srcset="img_avatar.png">
  <source srcset="img_girl.jpg">
  <img src="img_beatles.gif" alt="Beatles" style="width:auto;">
</picture>
Note: The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any following <source> elements.

(iii) HTML Image Tags
Tag	Description
<img>	Defines an image
<map>	Defines an image map
<area>	Defines a clickable area inside an image map
<picture>	Defines a container for multiple image resources

        (18) HTML Favicon

A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.

(i) How To Add a Favicon in HTML
You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your own favicon on sites like https://favicon.cc.

Tip: A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.

A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab.

Example of favicon
To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".

Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page Title</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
Now, save the "index.html" file and reload it in your browser. Your browser tab should now display your favicon image to the left of the page title.

(ii) Favicon File Format Support
The following table shows the file format support for a favicon image:

Browser	ICO	PNG	GIF	JPEG	SVG
Edge	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	    Yes
Chrome	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	    Yes
Firefox	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	    Yes
Opera	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	    Yes
Safari	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	    Yes

(iii) Chapter Summary
Use the HTML <link> element to insert a favicon
HTML Link Tag
Tag	Description
<link>	Defines the relationship between a document and an external resource

            (19) HTML Tables

    (a) HTML Tables
HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.

Example
Company	                         Contact	                        Country
Alfreds Futterkiste	             Maria Anders	                     Germany
Centro comercial Moctezuma     	Francisco Chang	                     Mexico
Ernst Handel	                Roland Mendel	                     Austria
Island Trading                 	Helen Bennett	                      UK
Laughing Bacchus Winecellars	Yoshi Tannamuri                    	Canada
Magazzini Alimentari Riuniti	Giovanni Rovelli                	Italy

(i) Define an HTML Table
A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns

Example
A simple HTML table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Contact</th>
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
    <td>Maria Anders</td>
    <td>Germany</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
    <td>Francisco Chang</td>
    <td>Mexico</td>
  </tr>
</table>

(ii) Table Cells
Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.

td stands for table data.

Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.

Example
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
    <td>Linus</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Note: table data elements are the data containers of the table.
They can contain all sorts of HTML elements; text, images, lists, other tables, etc.

(iii) Table Rows
Each table row starts with a <tr> and end with a </tr> tag.

tr stands for table row.

Example
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
    <td>Linus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
</table>
You can have as many rows as you like in a table, just make sure that the number of cells are the same in each row.

Note: There are times where a row can have less or more cells than another. You will learn about that in a later chapter.

(iv) Table Headers
Sometimes you want your cells to be headers, in those cases use the <th> tag instead of the <td> tag:

Example
Let the first row be table headers:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Person 1</th>
    <th>Person 2</th>
    <th>Person 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
    <td>Linus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
</table>
By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered, but you can change that with CSS.

(v) HTML Table Tags
Tag	            Description
<table>	        Defines a table
<th>	        Defines a header cell in a table
<tr>	        Defines a row in a table
<td>	        Defines a cell in a table
<caption>	    Defines a table caption
<colgroup>	    Specifies a group of one or more columns in a table for formatting
<col>	        Specifies column properties for each column within a <colgroup> element
<thead>	        Groups the header content in a table
<tbody>	        Groups the body content in a table
<tfoot>	        Groups the footer content in a table

        (b) HTML Table Borders
HTML tables can have borders of different styles and shapes.

(i) How To Add a Border
When you add a border to a table, you also add borders around each table cell:
To add a border, use the CSS border property on table, th, and td elements:

Example
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}

(ii) Collapsed Table Borders
To avoid having double borders like in the example above, set the CSS border-collapse property to collapse.

This will make the borders collapse into a single border:
 	 	 
Example
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

(iii) Style Table Borders
If you set a background color of each cell, and give the border a white color (the same as the document background), you get the impression of an invisible border:
	 	 
Example
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid white;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
th, td {
  background-color: #96D4D4;
}

(iv) Round Table Borders
With the border-radius property, the borders get rounded corners:

Example
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

(iv) Skip the border around the table by leaving out table from the css selector:

Example
th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

(v) Dotted Table Borders
With the border-style property, you can set the appereance of the border.

The following values are allowed:

dotted     
dashed     
solid     
double     
groove     
ridge     
inset     
outset     
none     
hidden

Example
 th, td {
  border-style: dotted;
}

(vi) Border Color
With the border-color property, you can set the color of the border.
	 
Example
 th, td {
  border-color: #96D4D4;
}

        (c) HTML Table Sizes
HTML tables can have different sizes for each column, row or the entire table.
 	 	 
Use the style attribute with the width or height properties to specify the size of a table, row or column.

(i) HTML Table Width
To set the width of a table, add the style attribute to the <table> element:

Example
Set the width of the table to 100%:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Note: Using a percentage as the size unit for a width means how wide will this element be compared to its parent element, which in this case is the <body> element.

(ii) HTML Table Column Width
 	 	 	 
To set the size of a specific column, add the style attribute on a <th> or <td> element:

Example
Set the width of the first column to 70%:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th style="width:70%">Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>

(iii) HTML Table Row Height
 	 	 
To set the height of a specific row, add the style attribute on a table row element:

Example
Set the height of the second row to 200 pixels:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr style="height:200px">
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>

        (d) HTML Table Headers
HTML tables can have headers for each column or row, or for many columns/rows.
	 	 
(i) HTML Table Headers
Table headers are defined with th elements, each th element represents a table cell.

Example
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>

(ii) Vertical Table Headers
To use the first column as table headers, define the first cell in each row as a th element:

Example
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Eve</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Age</th>
    <td>94</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
</table>

(iii) Align Table Headers
By default, table headers are bold and centered:

To left-align the table headers, use the CSS text-align property:

Example
th {
  text-align: left;
}

(iv) Header for Multiple Columns
You can have a header that spans over two or more columns.

To do this, use the colspan attribute on the <th> element:

Example
<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>

(v) Table Caption
You can add a caption that serves as a heading for the entire table.

To add a caption to a table, use the <caption> tag:

Example
<table style="width:100%">
  <caption>Monthly savings</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Month</th>
    <th>Savings</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>January</td>
    <td>$100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>February</td>
    <td>$50</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note: The <caption> tag should be inserted immediately after the <table> tag.


          <!--   CHAPTER 3  ************************************************************************************************** --> 

    (e) HTML Table Padding & Spacing
HTML tables can adjust the padding inside the cells, and also the space between the cells.

(i) HTML Table - Cell Padding
Cell padding is the space between the cell edges and the cell content.

By default the padding is set to 0.

To add padding on table cells, use the CSS padding property:

Example
th, td {
  padding: 15px;
}
To add padding only above the content, use the padding-top property.

And the others sides with the padding-bottom, padding-left, and padding-right properties:

Example
th, td {
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
  padding-left: 30px;
  padding-right: 40px;
}

(ii) HTML Table - Cell Spacing
Cell spacing is the space between each cell.

By default the space is set to 2 pixels.

To change the space between table cells, use the CSS border-spacing property on the table element:

Example
table {
  border-spacing: 30px;
}

    (f) HTML Table Colspan & Rowspan

HTML tables can have cells that spans over multiple rows and/or columns.

(i) HTML Table - Colspan
To make a cell span over multiple columns, use the colspan attribute:

Example
<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>43</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>57</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Note: The value of the colspan attribute represents the number of columns to span.

(ii) HTML Table - Rowspan
To make a cell span over multiple rows, use the rowspan attribute:

Example
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <td>Jill</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Phone</th>
    <td>555-1234</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>555-8745</td>
</tr>
</table>
Note: The value of the rowspan attribute represents the number of rows to span.

    (g) HTML Table Styling

Use CSS to make your tables look better.

(i) HTML Table - Zebra Stripes
If you add a background color on every other table row, you will get a nice zebra stripes effect.

To style every other table row element, use the :nth-child(even) selector like this:

Example
tr:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: #D6EEEE;
}
Note: If you use (odd) instead of (even), the styling will occur on row 1,3,5 etc. instead of 2,4,6 etc.

(ii) HTML Table - Vertical Zebra Stripes
To make vertical zebra stripes, style every other column, instead of every other row.

Set the :nth-child(even) for table data elements like this:

Example
td:nth-child(even), th:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: #D6EEEE;
}
Note: Put the :nth-child() selector on both th and td elements if you want to have the styling on both headers and regular table cells.

(iii) Combine Vertical and Horizontal Zebra Stripes
You can combine the styling from the two examples above and you will have stripes on every other row and every other column.

If you use a transparent color you will get an overlapping effect.

Use an rgba() color to specify the transparency of the color:

Example
tr:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: rgba(150, 212, 212, 0.4);
}

th:nth-child(even),td:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: rgba(150, 212, 212, 0.4);
}

(iv) Horizontal Dividers
If you specify borders only at the bottom of each table row, you will have a table with horizontal dividers.

Add the border-bottom property to all tr elements to get horizontal dividers:

Example
tr {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
}
Hoverable Table
Use the :hover selector on tr to highlight table rows on mouse over:

Example
tr:hover {background-color: #D6EEEE;}

    (h) HTML Table Colgroup

The <colgroup> element is used to style specific columns of a table.

(i) HTML Table Colgroup
If you want to style the two first columns of a table, use the <colgroup> and <col> elements.

The <colgroup> element should be used as a container for the column specifications.

Each group are specified with a <col> element.

The span attribute specifies how many columns that gets the style.

The style attribute specifies the style to give the columns.

Note: There is a very limited selection of legal CSS properties for colgroups.

Example
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col span="2" style="background-color: #D6EEEE">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>MON</th>
    <th>TUE</th>
    <th>WED</th>
    <th>THU</th>
...
</table>
Note: The <colgroup> tag must be a child of a <table> element and should be placed before any other table elements, like <thead>, <tr>, <td> etc., but after the <caption> element, if present.

(ii) Legal CSS Properties
There are only a very limited selection of CSS properties that are allowed to be used in the colgroup:

width property
visibility property
background properties
border properties

All other CSS properties will have no effect on your tables.

(iii) Multiple Col Elements
If you want to style more columns with different styles, use more <col> elements inside the <colgroup>:

Example
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col span="2" style="background-color: #D6EEEE">
    <col span="3" style="background-color: pink">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>MON</th>
    <th>TUE</th>
    <th>WED</th>
    <th>THU</th>
...
</table>
Empty Colgroups
If you want to style columns in the middle of a table, insert a "empty" <col> element (with no styles) for the columns before:

Example
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col span="3">
    <col span="2" style="background-color: pink">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>MON</th>
    <th>TUE</th>
    <th>WED</th>
    <th>THU</th>
...
</table>

(iv) Hide Columns
You can hide columns with the visibility: collapse property:

Example
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col span="2">
    <col span="3" style="visibility: collapse">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>MON</th>
    <th>TUE</th>
    <th>WED</th>
    <th>THU</th>
...
</table>

        (20) HTML Lists
      
HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.

    (a) Lists
(i) Unordered HTML List
An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:

Example
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

(ii) Ordered HTML List
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with numbers by default:

Example
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

(iii) HTML Description Lists
HTML also supports description lists.

A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.

The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term:

Example
<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl>

(iv) HTML List Tags
Tag	  Description
<ul>	Defines an unordered list
<ol>	Defines an ordered list
<li>	Defines a list item
<dl>	Defines a description list
<dt>	Defines a term in a description list
<dd>	Describes the term in a description list

For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference.

    (b) HTML Unordered Lists
The HTML <ul> tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list.

(i) Unordered HTML List
An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:

Example
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

(ii) Unordered HTML List - Choose List Item Marker
The CSS list-style-type property is used to define the style of the list item marker. It can have one of the following values:

Value	    Description
disc	    Sets the list item marker to a bullet (default)
circle	  Sets the list item marker to a circle
square	  Sets the list item marker to a square
none	    The list items will not be marked

Example - Disc
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

Example - Circle
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

Example - Square
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

Example - None
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

(iii) Nested HTML Lists
Lists can be nested (list inside list):

Example
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea
    <ul>
      <li>Black tea</li>
      <li>Green tea</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
Note: A list item (<li>) can contain a new list, and other HTML elements, like images and links, etc.

(iv) Horizontal List with CSS
HTML lists can be styled in many different ways with CSS.

One popular way is to style a list horizontally, to create a navigation menu:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #333333;
}

li {
  float: left;
}

li a {
  display: block;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

li a:hover {
  background-color: #111111;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="#news">News</a></li>
  <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
</ul>

</body>
</html>

<dt>	Defines a term in a description list
<dd>	Describes the term in a description list

For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference.

    (c) HTML Ordered Lists
The HTML <ol> tag defines an ordered list. An ordered list can be numerical or alphabetical.

(i) Ordered HTML List
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with numbers by default:

Example
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

(ii) Ordered HTML List - The Type Attribute
The type attribute of the <ol> tag, defines the type of the list item marker:

Type    	Description
type="1"	The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)
type="A"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters
type="a"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters
type="I"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers
type="i"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers

Numbers:
<ol type="1">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

Uppercase Letters:
<ol type="A">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

Lowercase Letters:
<ol type="a">

  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

(iii) Control List Counting
By default, an ordered list will start counting from 1. If you want to start counting from a specified number, you can use the start attribute:

Example
<ol start="50">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

(iv) Nested HTML Lists
Lists can be nested (list inside list):

Example
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Black tea</li>
      <li>Green tea</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>
Note: A list item (<li>) can contain a new list, and other HTML elements, like images and links, etc.

    (d) HTML Other Lists
HTML also supports description lists.

(i) HTML Description Lists
A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.

The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term:

Example
<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl>

(ii) Chapter Summary
Use the HTML <dl> element to define a description list
Use the HTML <dt> element to define the description term
Use the HTML <dd> element to describe the term in a description list

      (21) HTML Block and Inline Elements

HTML Block and Inline Elements
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

There are two display values: block and inline.

(i) Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <p> element is a block-level element.

The <div> element is a block-level element.

Example
<p>Hello World</p>
<div>Hello World</div>
Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

<address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas><dd><div><dl><dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure><footer><form><h1>-<h6><header><hr><li><main><nav><noscript><ol><p><pre><section><table><tfoot><ul><video>

(ii) Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

Example
<span>Hello World</span>
Here are the inline elements in HTML:

<a><abbr><acronym><b><bdo><big><br><button><cite><code><dfn><em><i><img><input><kbd><label><map><object><output><q><samp><script><select><small><span><strong><sub><sup><textarea><time><tt><var>

Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

(iii) The <div> Element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:

Example
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

(iv) The <span> Element
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:

Example
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
Chapter Summary
There are two display values: block and inline
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
The <div> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document

(v) HTML Tags
Tag	      Description
<div>	    Defines a section in a document (block-level)
<span>	  Defines a section in a document (inline)

For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference.

      (22) HTML class Attribute
The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

(i) Using The class Attribute
The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="city">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Tokyo</h2>
  <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
In the following example we have two <span> elements with a class attribute with the value of "note". Both <span> elements will be styled equally according to the .note style definition in the head section:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.note {
  font-size: 120%;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My <span class="note">Important</span> Heading</h1>
<p>This is some <span class="note">important</span> text.</p>

</body>
</html>
Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.

Note: The class name is case sensitive!

Tip: You can learn much more about CSS in our CSS Tutorial.

(ii) The Syntax For Class
To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}:

Example
Create a class named "city":

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>

</body>
</html>

(iii) Multiple Classes
HTML elements can belong to more than one class.

To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.

In the following example, the first <h2> element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class, and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes: 

Example
<h2 class="city main">London</h2>
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
Different Elements Can Share Same Class
Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.

In the following example, both <h2> and <p> points to the "city" class and will share the same style:

Example
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p class="city">Paris is the capital of France</p>
Use of The class Attribute in JavaScript
The class name can also be used by JavaScript to perform certain tasks for specific elements.

JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method:

Example
Click on a button to hide all elements with the class name "city":

<script>
function myFunction() {
  var x = document.getElementsByClassName("city");
  for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    x[i].style.display = "none";
  }
}
</script>
Don't worry if you don't understand the code in the example above.

You will learn more about JavaScript in our HTML JavaScript chapter, or you can study our JavaScript Tutorial.

(iv) Chapter Summary
The HTML class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element
Classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements
The class attribute can be used on any HTML element
The class name is case sensitive
Different HTML elements can point to the same class name
JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method

      (23) HTML id Attribute

The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.

(i) Using The id Attribute
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

In the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the id name "myHeader". This <h1> element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

</body>
</html>
Note: The id name is case sensitive!

Note: The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).

(ii) Difference Between Class and ID
A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:

Example
<style>
/* Style the element with the id "myHeader" */
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Style all elements with the class name "city" */
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>

/* An element with a unique id */
<h1 id="myHeader">My Cities</h1>

/* Multiple elements with same class */
<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>

(iii) HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.

Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.

To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it.

Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

Example
First, create a bookmark with the id attribute:

<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>  
Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:

Example
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page:

<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

(iv) Using The id Attribute in JavaScript
The id attribute can also be used by JavaScript to perform some tasks for that specific element.

JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method:

Example
Use the id attribute to manipulate text with JavaScript:

<script>
function displayResult() {
  document.getElementById("myHeader").innerHTML = "Have a nice day!";
}
</script>
Tip: Study JavaScript in the HTML JavaScript chapter, or in our JavaScript Tutorial.

(v) Chapter Summary
The id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element
The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document
The id attribute is used by CSS and JavaScript to style/select a specific element
The value of the id attribute is case sensitive
The id attribute is also used to create HTML bookmarks
JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method

      (24) HTML Iframes

An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.

(i) HTML Iframe Syntax
The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

Syntax
<iframe src="url" title="description"></iframe>
Tip: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the <iframe>. This is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the iframe is.

(ii) Iframe - Set Height and Width
Use the height and width attributes to specify the size of the iframe.

The height and width are specified in pixels by default:

Example
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" height="200" width="300" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
Or you can add the style attribute and use the CSS height and width properties:

Example
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="height:200px;width:300px;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

(iii) Iframe - Remove the Border
By default, an iframe has a border around it.

To remove the border, add the style attribute and use the CSS border property:

Example
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="border:none;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
With CSS, you can also change the size, style and color of the iframe's border:

Example
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="border:2px solid red;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
Iframe - Target for a Link
An iframe can be used as the target frame for a link.

The target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute of the iframe:

Example
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" name="iframe_a" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="iframe_a">W3Schools.com</a></p>

(iv) Chapter Summary
The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame
The src attribute defines the URL of the page to embed
Always include a title attribute (for screen readers)
The height and width attributes specifies the size of the iframe
Use border:none; to remove the border around the iframe

      (25) HTML JavaScript
JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.

Example
My First JavaScript
Click me to display Date and Time

(i) The HTML <script> Tag
The HTML <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).

The <script> element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.

Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.

To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method.

This JavaScript example writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":

Example
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
</script>
Tip: You can learn much more about JavaScript in our JavaScript Tutorial.

(ii) A Taste of JavaScript
Here are some examples of what JavaScript can do:

Example
JavaScript can change content:

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";

Example
JavaScript can change styles:

document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "25px";
document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "red";
document.getElementById("demo").style.backgroundColor = "yellow";

Example
JavaScript can change attributes:

document.getElementById("image").src = "picture.gif";

(iii) The HTML <noscript> Tag
The HTML <noscript> tag defines an alternate content to be displayed to users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support scripts:

Example
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
</script>
<noscript>Sorry, your browser does not support JavaScript!</noscript>

          /*   CHAPTER 4  ************************************************************************************************** */
  
            (26) HTML File Paths
        A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.
        
        (i) File Path Examples
        Path	Description
        <img src="picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page
        <img src="images/picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder
        <img src="/images/picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
        <img src="../picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder

        (ii) HTML File Paths
        A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.
        
        File paths are used when linking to external files, like:
        
        Web pages
        Images
        Style sheets
        JavaScripts
        Absolute File Paths
        An absolute file path is the full URL to a file:
        
        Example
        <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
        
        The <img> tag is explained in the chapter: HTML Images.
        
        (iii) Relative File Paths
        A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.
        
        In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:
        
        Example
        <img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
        
        In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:
        
        Example
        <img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
        
        In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level up from the current folder:
        
        Example
        <img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
        
        (iv) Best Practice
        It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).
        
        When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.
  

                              (27) HTML - The Head Element
                            
          The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.
          
          (i) The HTML <head> Element
          The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
          
          HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
          
          Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
          
          (ii) The HTML <title> Element
          The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
          
          The <title> element is required in HTML documents!
          
          The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
          
          The <title> element:
          
          defines a title in the browser toolbar
          provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
          displays a title for the page in search engine-results
          So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!
          
          A simple HTML document:
          
          Example
          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html>
          <head>
            <title>A Meaningful Page Title</title>
          </head>
          <body>
          
          The content of the document......
          
          </body>
          </html>
          (*) The HTML <style> Element
          The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page:
          
          Example
          <style>
            body {background-color: powderblue;}
            h1 {color: red;}
            p {color: blue;}
          </style>
          
          (iii) The HTML <link> Element
          The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
          
          The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets:
          
          Example
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
          Tip: To learn all about CSS, visit our CSS Tutorial.
          
          (iv) The HTML <meta> Element
          The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
          
          The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but are used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.
          
          Examples
          Define the character set used:
          
          <meta charset="UTF-8">
          Define keywords for search engines:
          
          <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
          Define a description of your web page:
          
          <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
          Define the author of a page:
          
          <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
          Refresh document every 30 seconds:
          
          <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
          Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices:
          
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
          Example of <meta> tags:
          
          Example
          <meta charset="UTF-8">
          <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
          <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
          <meta name="author" content="John Doe">

          (v) Setting The Viewport
          The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
          
          You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:
          
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
          This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
          
          The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
          
          The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
          
          Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:
          
          Tip: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links below to see the difference.
          
          (vi) The HTML <script> Element
          The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts.
          
          The following JavaScript writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":
          
          Example
          <script>
          function myFunction() {
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
          }
          </script>
          Tip: To learn all about JavaScript, visit our JavaScript Tutorial.
          
          (vii) The HTML <base> Element
          The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page.
          
          The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both.
          
          There can only be one single <base> element in a document!
          
          Example
          Specify a default URL and a default target for all links on a page:
          
          <head>
          <base href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">
          </head>
          
          <body>
          <img src="images/stickman.gif" width="24" height="39" alt="Stickman">
          <a href="tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base Tag</a>
          </body>

          (viii) HTML head Elements
          Tag	      Description
          <head>	  Defines information about the document
          <title>	  Defines the title of a document
          <base>	  Defines a default address or a default target for all links on a page
          <link>	  Defines the relationship between a document and an external resource
          <meta>	  Defines metadata about an HTML document
          <script>	Defines a client-side script
          <style>	  Defines style information for a document

          /*   CHAPTER 5  ************************************************************************************************** */

                   (28) HTML Layout Elements and Techniques
          Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or a newspaper).

         (1) HTML Layout Elements
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

HTML5 Semantic Elements	
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element
You can read more about semantic elements in our HTML Semantics chapter.

(2) HTML Layout Techniques
There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

CSS framework
CSS float property
CSS flexbox
CSS grid

(3) CSS Frameworks
If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a CSS framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.

Ever heard about W3Schools Spaces? Here you can create your website from scratch or use a template, and host it for free.

(4) CSS Float Layout
It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility. Learn more about float in our CSS Float and Clear chapter.

(5) CSS Flexbox Layout
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
Learn more about flexbox in our CSS Flexbox chapter.

(6) CSS Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
Learn more about CSS grids in our CSS Grid Intro chapter.

                        (29) HTML Responsive Web Design

            Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!
            
            A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.
            
            (i) Responsive Web Design
            What is Responsive Web Design?
            Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones):
            
            
            Setting The Viewport
            To create a responsive website, add the following <meta> tag to all your web pages:
            
            Example
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
            
            (ii) Responsive Images
            Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.
            
            Using the width Property
            If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down:
            
            
            Example
            <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;">
            Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead.
            
            (iii) Using the max-width Property
            If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:
            
            
            Example
            <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;color:purple">
            Show Different Images Depending on Browser Width
            The HTML <picture> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes.
            
            Resize the browser window to see how the image below change depending on the width:
            
            Flowers
            Example
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img_smallflower.jpg" media="(max-width: 600px)">
              <source srcset="img_flowers.jpg" media="(max-width: 1500px)">
              <source srcset="flowers.jpg">
              <img src="img_smallflower.jpg" alt="Flowers">
            </picture>

            (iv) Responsive Text Size
            The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".
            
            That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:
            
            Hello World
            Resize the browser window to see how the text size scales.
            
            Example
            <h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>
            Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.
            
            (v) Media Queries
            In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages.
            
            With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.
            
            Example: resize the browser window to see that the three div elements below will display horizontally on large screens and stacked vertically on small screens:
            
            Left Menu
            
            
            Main Content
            
            
            Right Content
            
            
            Example
            <style>
            .left, .right {
              float: left;
              width: 20%; /* The width is 20%, by default */
            }
            
            .main {
              float: left;
              width: 60%; /* The width is 60%, by default */
            }
            
            /* Use a media query to add a breakpoint at 800px: */
            @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
              .left, .main, .right {
                width: 100%; /* The width is 100%, when the viewport is 800px or smaller */
              }
            }
            </style>

            W3.CSS
            W3.CSS is a modern CSS framework with support for desktop, tablet, and mobile design by default.
            
            W3.CSS is smaller and faster than similar CSS frameworks.
            
            W3.CSS is designed to be a high quality alternative to Bootstrap.
            
            W3.CSS is designed to be independent of jQuery or any other JavaScript library.
   
            Example
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
            <body>
            
            <div class="w3-container w3-green">
              <h1>W3Schools Demo</h1>
              <p>Resize this responsive page!</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="w3-row-padding">
              <div class="w3-third">
                <h2>London</h2>
                <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
                <p>It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom,
                with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
              </div>
            
              <div class="w3-third">
                <h2>Paris</h2>
                <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
                <p>The Paris area is one of the largest population centers in Europe,
                with more than 12 million inhabitants.</p>
              </div>
            
              <div class="w3-third">
                <h2>Tokyo</h2>

            (viii) Bootstrap
            Another popular CSS framework is Bootstrap. Bootstrap uses HTML, CSS and jQuery to make responsive web pages.
            
            Example
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html lang="en">
            <head>
            <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
            <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
            <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
            </head>
            <body>
            
            <div class="container">
              <div class="jumbotron">
                <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  ...
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  ...
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                ...
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            </body>
            </html>

            /*   CHAPTER 6  ************************************************************************************************** */
        
          (30) HTML Computer Code Elements
HTML contains several elements for defining user input and computer code.

Example
<code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>

(i) HTML <kbd> For Keyboard Input
The HTML <kbd> element is used to define keyboard input. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Example
Define some text as keyboard input in a document:

<p>Save the document by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd></p>
Result:

Save the document by pressing Ctrl + S

(ii) HTML <samp> For Program Output
The HTML <samp> element is used to define sample output from a computer program. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Example
Define some text as sample output from a computer program in a document:

<p>Message from my computer:</p>
<p><samp>File not found.<br>Press F1 to continue</samp></p>
Result:

Message from my computer:
File not found.
Press F1 to continue

(iii) HTML <code> For Computer Code
The HTML <code> element  is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Example
Define some text as computer code in a document:

<code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>
Result:

x = 5; y = 6; z = x + y;
Notice that the <code> element does not preserve extra whitespace and line-breaks.

To fix this, you can put the <code> element inside a <pre> element:

Example
<pre>
<code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>
</pre>
Result:

x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;

(iv) HTML <var> For Variables
The HTML <var> element  is used to define a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Example
Define some text as variables in a document:

<p>The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x <var>b</var> x <var>h</var>, where <var>b</var> is the base, and <var>h</var> is the vertical height.</p>
Result:

The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x b x h, where b is the base, and h is the vertical height.

(v) Chapter Summary
The <kbd> element defines keyboard input
The <samp> element defines sample output from a computer program
The <code> element defines a piece of computer code
The <var> element defines a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression
The <pre> element defines preformatted text

          (31) HTML Semantic Elements

Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

(i) What are Semantic Elements?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Semantic Elements in HTML
Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>

(ii) HTML Semantic Elements
HTML <section> Element
The <section> element defines a section in a document.

According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."

Examples of where a <section> element can be used:

Chapters
Introduction
News items
Contact information
A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.

Example
Two sections in a document:

<section>
<h1>WWF</h1>
<p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h1>WWF's Panda symbol</h1>
<p>The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. The well-known panda logo of WWF originated from a panda named Chi Chi that was transferred from the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo in the same year of the establishment of WWF.</p>
</section>

HTML <article> Element
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.

Examples of where the <article> element can be used:

Forum posts
Blog posts
User comments
Product cards
Newspaper articles
Example
Three articles with independent, self-contained content:

<article>
<h2>Google Chrome</h2>
<p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular web browser today!</p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
<p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since January, 2018.</p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Microsoft Edge</h2>
<p>Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015. Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer.</p>
</article>

Example 2
Use CSS to style the <article> element:

<html>
<head>
<style>
.all-browsers {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 5px;
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.all-browsers > h1, .browser {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
}

.browser {
  background: white;
}

.browser > h2, p {
  margin: 4px;
  font-size: 90%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<article class="all-browsers">
  <h1>Most Popular Browsers</h1>
  <article class="browser">
    <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
    <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular web browser today!</p>
  </article>
  <article class="browser">
    <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
    <p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since January, 2018.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="browser">
    <h2>Microsoft Edge</h2>
    <p>Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015. Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer.</p>
  </article>
</article>

</body>
</html>

(iii) Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

The <section> element defines section in a document.

Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!

So, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <section> elements.

HTML <header> Element
The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

A <header> element typically contains:

one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
logo or icon
authorship information
Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.

Example
A header for an <article>: 

<article>
  <header>
    <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
    <p>WWF's mission:</p>
  </header>
  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment,
  and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
</article>

(iv) HTML <footer> Element
The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section.

A <footer> element typically contains:

authorship information
copyright information
contact information
sitemap
back to top links
related documents
You can have several <footer> elements in one document.

Example
A footer section in a document:

<footer>
  <p>Author: Hege Refsnes</p>
  <p><a href="mailto:hege@example.com">hege@example.com</a></p>
</footer>

(v) HTML <nav> Element
The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.

Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major block of navigation links.

Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.

Example
A set of navigation links:

<nav>
  <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
  <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
  <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
  <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
</nav>

(vi) HTML <aside> Element
The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).

The <aside> content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.

Example
Display some content aside from the content it is placed in:

<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p>

<aside>
<h4>Epcot Center</h4>
<p>Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p>
</aside>
Example 2
Use CSS to style the <aside> element:

<html>
<head>
<style>
aside {
  width: 30%;
  padding-left: 15px;
  margin-left: 15px;
  float: right;
  font-style: italic;
  background-color: lightgray;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p>

<aside>
<p>The Epcot center is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p>
</aside>

<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p>
<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p>

</body>
</html>

(vii) HTML <figure> and <figcaption> Elements
The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a <figure> element.

The <img> element defines the actual image/illustration. 

Example
<figure>
  <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
  <figcaption>Fig1. - Trulli, Puglia, Italy.</figcaption>
</figure>
Why Semantic Elements?
According to the W3C: "A semantic Web allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities."

          (32) HTML Style Guide
A consistent, clean, and tidy HTML code makes it easier for others to read and understand your code.

Here are some guidelines and tips for creating good HTML code.

(i) Always Declare Document Type
Always declare the document type as the first line in your document.

The correct document type for HTML is:

<!DOCTYPE html>
Use Lowercase Element Names
HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.

However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because:

Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
Developers normally use lowercase names
Lowercase looks cleaner
Lowercase is easier to write
Good:
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
Bad:
<BODY>
<P>This is a paragraph.</P>
</BODY>

(ii) Close All HTML Elements
In HTML, you do not have to close all elements (for example the <p> element).

However, we strongly recommend closing all HTML elements, like this:

Good:
<section>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</section>
Bad:
<section>
  <p>This is a paragraph.
  <p>This is a paragraph.
</section>

(iii) Use Lowercase Attribute Names
HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in attribute names.

However, we recommend using lowercase attribute names, because:

Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
Developers normally use lowercase names
Lowercase look cleaner
Lowercase are easier to write
Good:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Bad:
<a HREF="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>

(iii) Always Quote Attribute Values
HTML allows attribute values without quotes.

However, we recommend quoting attribute values, because:

Developers normally quote attribute values
Quoted values are easier to read
You MUST use quotes if the value contains spaces
Good:
<table class="striped">
Bad:
<table class=striped>
Very bad:
This will not work, because the value contains spaces:

<table class=table striped>

(iv) Always Specify alt, width, and height for Images
Always specify the alt attribute for images. This attribute is important if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.

Also, always define the width and height of images. This reduces flickering, because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading.

Good:
<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5" style="width:128px;height:128px">
Bad:
<img src="html5.gif">
Spaces and Equal Signs
HTML allows spaces around equal signs. But space-less is easier to read and groups entities better together.

Good:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Bad:
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "styles.css">

(v) Avoid Long Code Lines
When using an HTML editor, it is NOT convenient to scroll right and left to read the HTML code.

Try to avoid too long code lines.

(vi) Blank Lines and Indentation
Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason.

For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks.

For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.

Good:
<body>

<h1>Famous Cities</h1>

<h2>Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the center of the Greater Tokyo Area,
and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.
It is the seat of the Japanese government and the Imperial Palace,
and the home of the Japanese Imperial Family.</p>

</body>
Bad:
<body>

  <h1>Famous Cities</h1>

  <h2>Tokyo</h2>

  <p>
    Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the center of the Greater Tokyo Area,
    and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.
    It is the seat of the Japanese government and the Imperial Palace,
    and the home of the Japanese Imperial Family.
  </p>

</body>
Good Table Example:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>Description of A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>Description of B</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Good List Example:
<ul>
  <li>London</li>
  <li>Paris</li>
  <li>Tokyo</li>
</ul>

(vii) Never Skip the <title> Element
The <title> element is required in HTML.

The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser toolbar
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search-engine results
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible: 

<title>HTML Style Guide and Coding Conventions</title>

(viii) Omitting <html> and <body>?
An HTML page will validate without the <html> and <body> tags:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
However, we strongly recommend to always add the <html> and <body> tags!

Omitting <body> can produce errors in older browsers.

Omitting <html> and <body> can also crash DOM and XML software.

(ix) Omitting <head>?
The HTML <head> tag can also be omitted.

Browsers will add all elements before <body>, to a default <head> element.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title>Page Title</title>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
However, we recommend using the <head> tag.

(x) Close Empty HTML Elements?
In HTML, it is optional to close empty elements.

Allowed:
<meta charset="utf-8">
Also Allowed:
<meta charset="utf-8" />
If you expect XML/XHTML software to access your page, keep the closing slash (/), because it is required in XML and XHTML.

(xi) Add the lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

(xii) Meta Data
To ensure proper interpretation and correct search engine indexing, both the language and the character encoding <meta charset="charset"> should be defined as early as possible in an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>

(xiii) Setting The Viewport
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:

Tip: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links below to see the difference.

(xiv) HTML Comments
Short comments should be written on one line, like this:

<!-- This is a comment -->
Comments that spans more than one line, should be written like this:

<!--
  This is a long comment example. This is a long comment example.
  This is a long comment example. This is a long comment example.
-->
Long comments are easier to observe if they are indented with two spaces.

(xv) Using Style Sheets
Use simple syntax for linking to style sheets (the type attribute is not necessary):

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Short CSS rules can be written compressed, like this:

p.intro {font-family:Verdana;font-size:16em;}
Long CSS rules should be written over multiple lines:

body {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  font-family: "Arial Black", Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 16em;
  color: black;
}

Place the opening bracket on the same line as the selector
Use one space before the opening bracket
Use two spaces of indentation
Use semicolon after each property-value pair, including the last
Only use quotes around values if the value contains spaces
Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces

(xvi) Loading JavaScript in HTML
Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary):

<script src="myscript.js">
Accessing HTML Elements with JavaScript
Using "untidy" HTML code can result in JavaScript errors.

These two JavaScript statements will produce different results:

Example
getElementById("Demo").innerHTML = "Hello";

getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello";
Visit the JavaScript Style Guide.

(xvii) Use Lower Case File Names
Some web servers (Apache, Unix) are case sensitive about file names: "london.jpg" cannot be accessed as "London.jpg".

Other web servers (Microsoft, IIS) are not case sensitive: "london.jpg" can be accessed as "London.jpg".

If you use a mix of uppercase and lowercase, you have to be aware of this.

If you move from a case-insensitive to a case-sensitive server, even small errors will break your web!

To avoid these problems, always use lowercase file names!

(xviii) File Extensions
HTML files should have a .html extension (.htm is allowed).

CSS files should have a .css extension.

JavaScript files should have a .js extension.

(xix) Differences Between .htm and .html?
There is no difference between the .htm and .html file extensions!

Both will be treated as HTML by any web browser and web server.

(xx) Default Filenames
When a URL does not specify a filename at the end (like "https://www.w3schools.com/"), the server just adds a default filename, such as "index.html", "index.htm", "default.html", or "default.htm".

If your server is configured only with "index.html" as the default filename, your file must be named "index.html", and not "default.html".

However, servers can be configured with more than one default filename; usually you can set up as many default filenames as you want.

                      (33)  HTML Entities
HTML Entities
Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.

(i) HTML Entities
Some characters are reserved in HTML.

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.

Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

A character entity looks like this:

&entity_name;
OR

&#entity_number;
To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;

Advantage of using an entity name: An entity name is easy to remember.
Disadvantage of using an entity name: Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.

(ii) Non-breaking Space
A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;

A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.

Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.

Examples:

§ 10
10 km/h
10 PM
Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.

If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity.

Tip: The non-breaking hyphen (&#8209;) is used to define a hyphen character (‑) that does not break into a new line.

Note: Entity names are case sensitive.

(iv) Combining Diacritical Marks
A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.

Some diacritical marks, like grave (  ̀) and acute (  ́) are called accents.

Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter, and between two letters.

Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.

Here are some examples:

Mark     	Character      	Construct	        Result	
 ̀	          a	             a&#768;        	à	
 ́	          a	             a&#769;	        á	
̂	            a            	 a&#770;	        â	
 ̃	          a	             a&#771;	        ã	
 ̀	          O	             O&#768;        	Ò	
 ́ 	          O            	 O&#769;        	Ó	
̂	            O	             O&#770;	        Ô	
 ̃	          O	             O&#771;        	Õ	

          (34) HTML Symbols
Symbols that are not present on your keyboard can also be added by using entities.

(i) HTML Symbol Entities
HTML entities were described in the previous chapter.

Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.

To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference) for the symbol.

Example
Display the euro sign, €, with an entity name, a decimal, and a hexadecimal value:

<p>I will display &euro;</p>
<p>I will display &#8364;</p>
<p>I will display &#x20AC;</p>
Will display as:
I will display €
I will display €
I will display €

        (35) Using Emojis in HTML
Emojis are characters from the UTF-8 character set: 😄 😍 💗

(i) What are Emojis?
Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not.

They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set.

UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.

(ii) The HTML charset Attribute
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.

This is specified in the <meta> tag:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
If not specified, UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML.

(iii) UTF-8 Characters
Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers):

A is 65
B is 66
C is 67

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>

<p>I will display A B C</p>
<p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p>

</body>
</html>

Example Explained
The <meta charset="UTF-8"> element defines the character set.

The characters A, B, and C, are displayed by the numbers 65, 66, and 67.

To let the browser understand that you are displaying a character, you must start the entity number with &# and end it with ; (semicolon).

Emoji Characters
Emojis are also characters from the UTF-8 alphabet:

😄 is 128516
😍 is 128525
💗 is 128151

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Emoji</h1>

<p>&#128512;</p>

</body>
</html>
Since Emojis are characters, they can be copied, displayed, and sized just like any other character in HTML.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>

<h1>Sized Emojis</h1>

<p style="font-size:48px">
&#128512; &#128516; &#128525; &#128151;
</p>

</body>
</html>

        (36) HTML Encoding (Character Sets)
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.

From ASCII to UTF-8
ASCII was the first character encoding standard. ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .

ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set supported 256 different character codes. HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.

ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.

The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!

The HTML charset Attribute
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.

This is specified in the <meta> tag:

<meta charset="UTF-8">

A URL is another word for a web address.

A URL can be composed of words (e.g. w3schools.com), or an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50).

Most people enter the name when surfing, because names are easier to remember than numbers.

URL - Uniform Resource Locator
Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address a document (or other data) on the web.

A web address like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules:

scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename
Explanation:

scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
filename - defines the name of a document or resource
Common URL Schemes
The table below lists some common schemes:

Scheme	Short for	Used for
http	HyperText Transfer Protocol	Common web pages. Not encrypted
https	Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol	Secure web pages. Encrypted
ftp	File Transfer Protocol	Downloading or uploading files
file	 	A file on your computer

URL Encoding
URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted.

URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.

URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.

URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.

Try It Yourself
Hello Günter
 
If you click "Submit", the browser will URL encode the input before it is sent to the server.

A page at the server will display the received input.

Try some other input and click Submit again.

ASCII Encoding Examples
Your browser will encode input, according to the character-set used in your page.

The default character-set in HTML5 is UTF-8.

Character	From Windows-1252	From UTF-8
€	%80	%E2%82%AC
£	%A3	%C2%A3
©	%A9	%C2%A9
®	%AE	%C2%AE
À	%C0	%C3%80
Á	%C1	%C3%81
Â	%C2	%C3%82
Ã	%C3	%C3%83
Ä	%C4	%C3%84
Å	%C5	%C3%85

            (38) HTML Versus XHTML
XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML.

What is XHTML?
XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML
XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
XHTML is supported by all major browsers
Why XHTML?
XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").

XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.

If you want to study XML, please read our XML Tutorial.

                            /*   CHAPTER 8  ************************************************************************************************** */

            (39) HTML Forms
An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

Example
First name:
John

Last name:
Doe


The <form> Element
The HTML <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input:

<form>
.
form elements
.
</form>
The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

All the different form elements are covered in this chapter: HTML Form Elements.

The <input> Element
The HTML <input> element is the most used form element.

An <input> element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the type attribute.

Here are some examples:

Type	Description
<input type="text">	Displays a single-line text input field
<input type="radio">	Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
<input type="checkbox">	Displays a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices)
<input type="submit">	Displays a submit button (for submitting the form)
<input type="button">	Displays a clickable button
All the different input types are covered in this chapter: HTML Input Types.

Text Fields
The <input type="text"> defines a single-line input field for text input.

Example
A form with input fields for text:

<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

First name:

Last name:
Note: The form itself is not visible. Also note that the default width of an input field is 20 characters.

The <label> Element
Notice the use of the <label> element in the example above.

The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements.

The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.

The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.

Radio Buttons
The <input type="radio"> defines a radio button.

Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices.

Example
A form with radio buttons:

<p>Choose your favorite Web language:</p>

<form>
  <input type="radio" id="html" name="fav_language" value="HTML">
  <label for="html">HTML</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="css" name="fav_language" value="CSS">
  <label for="css">CSS</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="javascript" name="fav_language" value="JavaScript">
  <label for="javascript">JavaScript</label>
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

Choose your favorite Web language:

 HTML
 CSS
 JavaScript
Checkboxes
The <input type="checkbox"> defines a checkbox.

Checkboxes let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices.

Example
A form with checkboxes:

<form>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">
  <label for="vehicle1"> I have a bike</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle2" name="vehicle2" value="Car">
  <label for="vehicle2"> I have a car</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat">
  <label for="vehicle3"> I have a boat</label>
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

 I have a bike
 I have a car
 I have a boat
The Submit Button
The <input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler.

The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing input data.

The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute.

Example
A form with a submit button:

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

First name:
John

Last name:
Doe


The Name Attribute for <input>
Notice that each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.

If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.

Example
This example will not submit the value of the "First name" input field: 

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" value="John"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

                  (40) HTML Form Attributes
This chapter describes the different attributes for the HTML <form> element.

The Action Attribute
The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data:

Example
On submit, send form data to "action_page.php":

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
Tip: If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.

The Target Attribute
The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

Value	Description
_blank	The response is displayed in a new window or tab
_self	The response is displayed in the current window
_parent	The response is displayed in the parent frame
_top	The response is displayed in the full body of the window
framename	The response is displayed in a named iframe
The default value is _self which means that the response will open in the current window.

Example
Here, the submitted result will open in a new browser tab:

<form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank">
The Method Attribute
The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.

The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").

The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. 

Example
This example uses the GET method when submitting the form data:

<form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
Example
This example uses the POST method when submitting the form data:

<form action="/action_page.php" method="post">
Notes on GET:

Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
Notes on POST:

Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information!

ADVERTISEMENT

The Autocomplete Attribute
The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.

When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.

Example
A form with autocomplete on:

<form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on">
The Novalidate Attribute
The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute.

When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted.

Example
A form with a novalidate attribute:

<form action="/action_page.php" novalidate>

                (41) HTML Form Elements
This chapter describes all the different HTML form elements.

The HTML <form> Elements
The HTML <form> element can contain one or more of the following form elements:

<input>
<label>
<select>
<textarea>
<button>
<fieldset>
<legend>
<datalist>
<output>
<option>
<optgroup>
The <input> Element
One of the most used form element is the <input> element.

The <input> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.

Example
<label for="fname">First name:</label>
<input type="text" id="fname" name="fname">
All the different values of the type attribute are covered in the next chapter: HTML Input Types.

The <label> Element
The <label> element defines a label for several form elements.

The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.

The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.

The <select> Element
The <select> element defines a drop-down list:

Example
<label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>
<select id="cars" name="cars">
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="fiat">Fiat</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>
The <option> elements defines an option that can be selected.

By default, the first item in the drop-down list is selected.

To define a pre-selected option, add the selected attribute to the option:

Example
<option value="fiat" selected>Fiat</option>
Visible Values:
Use the size attribute to specify the number of visible values:

Example
<label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>
<select id="cars" name="cars" size="3">
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="fiat">Fiat</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>
Allow Multiple Selections:
Use the multiple attribute to allow the user to select more than one value:

Example
<label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>
<select id="cars" name="cars" size="4" multiple>
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="fiat">Fiat</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>
The <textarea> Element
The <textarea> element defines a multi-line input field (a text area):

Example
<textarea name="message" rows="10" cols="30">
The cat was playing in the garden.
</textarea>
The rows attribute specifies the visible number of lines in a text area.

The cols attribute specifies the visible width of a text area.

This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

The cat was playing in the garden.

You can also define the size of the text area by using CSS:

Example
<textarea name="message" style="width:200px; height:600px;">
The cat was playing in the garden.
</textarea>

The <button> Element
The <button> element defines a clickable button:

Example
<button type="button" onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Click Me!</button>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

Click Me!
Note: Always specify the type attribute for the button element. Different browsers may use different default types for the button element.

The <fieldset> and <legend> Elements
The <fieldset> element is used to group related data in a form.

The <legend> element defines a caption for the <fieldset> element.

Example
<form action="/action_page.php">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Personalia:</legend>
    <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </fieldset>
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

Personalia:
First name:
John

Last name:
Doe


The <datalist> Element
The <datalist> element specifies a list of pre-defined options for an <input> element.

Users will see a drop-down list of the pre-defined options as they input data.

The list attribute of the <input> element, must refer to the id attribute of the <datalist> element.

Example
<form action="/action_page.php">
  <input list="browsers">
  <datalist id="browsers">
    <option value="Internet Explorer">
    <option value="Firefox">
    <option value="Chrome">
    <option value="Opera">
    <option value="Safari">
  </datalist>
</form>
The <output> Element
The <output> element represents the result of a calculation (like one performed by a script).

Example
Perform a calculation and show the result in an <output> element:

<form action="/action_page.php"
  oninput="x.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
  0
  <input type="range"  id="a" name="a" value="50">
  100 +
  <input type="number" id="b" name="b" value="50">
  =
  <output name="x" for="a b"></output>
  <br><br>
  <input type="submit">
</form>
                    
                (42) HTML Input Types
This chapter describes the different types for the HTML <input> element.

HTML Input Types
Here are the different input types you can use in HTML:

<input type="button">
<input type="checkbox">
<input type="color">
<input type="date">
<input type="datetime-local">
<input type="email">
<input type="file">
<input type="hidden">
<input type="image">
<input type="month">
<input type="number">
<input type="password">

<input type="reset">
<input type="search">
<input type="submit">
<input type="tel">
<input type="text">
<input type="time">
<input type="url">
<input type="week">
Tip: The default value of the type attribute is "text".

Input Type Text
<input type="text"> defines a single-line text input field:

Example
<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

First name:

Last name:

Input Type Password
<input type="password"> defines a password field:

Example
<form>
  <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br>
  <label for="pwd">Password:</label><br>
  <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd">
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

Username:

Password:
The characters in a password field are masked (shown as asterisks or circles).

Input Type Submit
<input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting form data to a form-handler.

The form-handler is typically a server page with a script for processing input data.

The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute:

Example
<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

First name:
John

Last name:
Doe


If you omit the submit button's value attribute, the button will get a default text:

Example
<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit">
</form>
Input Type Reset
<input type="reset"> defines a reset button that will reset all form values to their default values:

Example
<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  <input type="reset">
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

First name:
John

Last name:
Doe

If you change the input values and then click the "Reset" button, the form-data will be reset to the default values.

Input Type Radio
<input type="radio"> defines a radio button.

Radio buttons let a user select ONLY ONE of a limited number of choices:

Example
<p>Choose your favorite Web language:</p>

<form>
  <input type="radio" id="html" name="fav_language" value="HTML">
  <label for="html">HTML</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="css" name="fav_language" value="CSS">
  <label for="css">CSS</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="javascript" name="fav_language" value="JavaScript">
  <label for="javascript">JavaScript</label>
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

 HTML
 CSS
 JavaScript
Input Type Checkbox
<input type="checkbox"> defines a checkbox.

Checkboxes let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices.

Example
<form>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">
  <label for="vehicle1"> I have a bike</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle2" name="vehicle2" value="Car">
  <label for="vehicle2"> I have a car</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat">
  <label for="vehicle3"> I have a boat</label>
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

 I have a bike
 I have a car
 I have a boat
Input Type Button
<input type="button"> defines a button:

Example
<input type="button" onclick="alert('Hello World!')" value="Click Me!">
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

Input Type Color
The <input type="color"> is used for input fields that should contain a color.

Depending on browser support, a color picker can show up in the input field.

Example
<form>
  <label for="favcolor">Select your favorite color:</label>
  <input type="color" id="favcolor" name="favcolor">
</form>
Input Type Date
The <input type="date"> is used for input fields that should contain a date.

Depending on browser support, a date picker can show up in the input field.

Example
<form>
  <label for="birthday">Birthday:</label>
  <input type="date" id="birthday" name="birthday">
</form>
You can also use the min and max attributes to add restrictions to dates:

Example
<form>
  <label for="datemax">Enter a date before 1980-01-01:</label>
  <input type="date" id="datemax" name="datemax" max="1979-12-31"><br><br>
  <label for="datemin">Enter a date after 2000-01-01:</label>
  <input type="date" id="datemin" name="datemin" min="2000-01-02">
</form>
Input Type Datetime-local
The <input type="datetime-local"> specifies a date and time input field, with no time zone.

Depending on browser support, a date picker can show up in the input field.

Example
<form>
  <label for="birthdaytime">Birthday (date and time):</label>
  <input type="datetime-local" id="birthdaytime" name="birthdaytime">
</form>
Input Type Email
The <input type="email"> is used for input fields that should contain an e-mail address.

Depending on browser support, the e-mail address can be automatically validated when submitted.

Some smartphones recognize the email type, and add ".com" to the keyboard to match email input.

Example
<form>
  <label for="email">Enter your email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
</form>
Input Type File
The <input type="file"> defines a file-select field and a "Browse" button for file uploads.

Example
<form>
  <label for="myfile">Select a file:</label>
  <input type="file" id="myfile" name="myfile">
</form>
Input Type Hidden
The <input type="hidden"> defines a hidden input field (not visible to a user).

A hidden field lets web developers include data that cannot be seen or modified by users when a form is submitted.

A hidden field often stores what database record that needs to be updated when the form is submitted.

Note: While the value is not displayed to the user in the page's content, it is visible (and can be edited) using any browser's developer tools or "View Source" functionality. Do not use hidden inputs as a form of security!

Example
<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <input type="hidden" id="custId" name="custId" value="3487">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
Input Type Month
The <input type="month"> allows the user to select a month and year.

Depending on browser support, a date picker can show up in the input field.

Example
<form>
  <label for="bdaymonth">Birthday (month and year):</label>
  <input type="month" id="bdaymonth" name="bdaymonth">
</form>
Input Type Number
The <input type="number"> defines a numeric input field.

You can also set restrictions on what numbers are accepted.

The following example displays a numeric input field, where you can enter a value from 1 to 5:

Example
<form>
  <label for="quantity">Quantity (between 1 and 5):</label>
  <input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" max="5">
</form>
Input Restrictions
Here is a list of some common input restrictions:

Attribute	Description
checked 	Specifies that an input field should be pre-selected when the page loads (for type="checkbox" or type="radio")
disabled	Specifies that an input field should be disabled
max	      Specifies the maximum value for an input field
maxlength	Specifies the maximum number of character for an input field
min	      Specifies the minimum value for an input field
pattern	  Specifies a regular expression to check the input value against
readonly	Specifies that an input field is read only (cannot be changed)
required	Specifies that an input field is required (must be filled out)
size	    Specifies the width (in characters) of an input field
step	    Specifies the legal number intervals for an input field
value	    Specifies the default value for an input field
You will learn more about input restrictions in the next chapter.

The following example displays a numeric input field, where you can enter a value from 0 to 100, in steps of 10. The default value is 30:

Example
<form>
  <label for="quantity">Quantity:</label>
  <input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="0" max="100" step="10" value="30">
</form>
Input Type Range
The <input type="range"> defines a control for entering a number whose exact value is not important (like a slider control). Default range is 0 to 100. However, you can set restrictions on what numbers are accepted with the min, max, and step attributes:

Example
<form>
  <label for="vol">Volume (between 0 and 50):</label>
  <input type="range" id="vol" name="vol" min="0" max="50">
</form>
Input Type Search
The <input type="search"> is used for search fields (a search field behaves like a regular text field).

Example
<form>
  <label for="gsearch">Search Google:</label>
  <input type="search" id="gsearch" name="gsearch">
</form>
Input Type Tel
The <input type="tel"> is used for input fields that should contain a telephone number.

Example
<form>
  <label for="phone">Enter your phone number:</label>
  <input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}">
</form>
Input Type Time
The <input type="time"> allows the user to select a time (no time zone).

Depending on browser support, a time picker can show up in the input field.

Example
<form>
  <label for="appt">Select a time:</label>
  <input type="time" id="appt" name="appt">
</form>
Input Type Url
The <input type="url"> is used for input fields that should contain a URL address.

Depending on browser support, the url field can be automatically validated when submitted.

Some smartphones recognize the url type, and adds ".com" to the keyboard to match url input.

Example
<form>
  <label for="homepage">Add your homepage:</label>
  <input type="url" id="homepage" name="homepage">
</form>
Input Type Week
The <input type="week"> allows the user to select a week and year.

Depending on browser support, a date picker can show up in the input field.

Example
<form>
  <label for="week">Select a week:</label>
  <input type="week" id="week" name="week">
</form>

            (43) HTML Input Attributes
This chapter describes the different attributes for the HTML <input> element.

The value Attribute
The input value attribute specifies an initial value for an input field:

Example
Input fields with initial (default) values:

<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe">
</form>
The readonly Attribute
The input readonly attribute specifies that an input field is read-only.

A read-only input field cannot be modified (however, a user can tab to it, highlight it, and copy the text from it).

The value of a read-only input field will be sent when submitting the form!

Example
A read-only input field:

<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John" readonly><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe">
</form>
The disabled Attribute
The input disabled attribute specifies that an input field should be disabled.

A disabled input field is unusable and un-clickable.

The value of a disabled input field will not be sent when submitting the form!

Example
A disabled input field:

<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John" disabled><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe">
</form>

The size Attribute
The input size attribute specifies the visible width, in characters, of an input field.

The default value for size is 20.

Note: The size attribute works with the following input types: text, search, tel, url, email, and password.

Example
Set a width for an input field:

<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" size="50"><br>
  <label for="pin">PIN:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="pin" name="pin" size="4">
</form>
The maxlength Attribute
The input maxlength attribute specifies the maximum number of characters allowed in an input field.

Note: When a maxlength is set, the input field will not accept more than the specified number of characters. However, this attribute does not provide any feedback. So, if you want to alert the user, you must write JavaScript code.

Example
Set a maximum length for an input field:

<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" size="50"><br>
  <label for="pin">PIN:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="pin" name="pin" maxlength="4" size="4">
</form>
The min and max Attributes
The input min and max attributes specify the minimum and maximum values for an input field.

The min and max attributes work with the following input types: number, range, date, datetime-local, month, time and week.

Tip: Use the max and min attributes together to create a range of legal values.

Example
Set a max date, a min date, and a range of legal values:

<form>
  <label for="datemax">Enter a date before 1980-01-01:</label>
  <input type="date" id="datemax" name="datemax" max="1979-12-31"><br><br>

  <label for="datemin">Enter a date after 2000-01-01:</label>
  <input type="date" id="datemin" name="datemin" min="2000-01-02"><br><br>

  <label for="quantity">Quantity (between 1 and 5):</label>
  <input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" max="5">
</form>
The multiple Attribute
The input multiple attribute specifies that the user is allowed to enter more than one value in an input field.

The multiple attribute works with the following input types: email, and file.

Example
A file upload field that accepts multiple values:

<form>
  <label for="files">Select files:</label>
  <input type="file" id="files" name="files" multiple>
</form>
The pattern Attribute
The input pattern attribute specifies a regular expression that the input field's value is checked against, when the form is submitted.

The pattern attribute works with the following input types: text, date, search, url, tel, email, and password.

Tip: Use the global title attribute to describe the pattern to help the user.

Tip: Learn more about regular expressions in our JavaScript tutorial.

Example
An input field that can contain only three letters (no numbers or special characters):

<form>
  <label for="country_code">Country code:</label>
  <input type="text" id="country_code" name="country_code"
  pattern="[A-Za-z]{3}" title="Three letter country code">
</form>
The placeholder Attribute
The input placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field (a sample value or a short description of the expected format).

The short hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value.

The placeholder attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, and password.

Example
An input field with a placeholder text:

<form>
  <label for="phone">Enter a phone number:</label>
  <input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone"
  placeholder="123-45-678"
  pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}">
</form>
The required Attribute
The input required attribute specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form.

The required attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, date pickers, number, checkbox, radio, and file.

Example
A required input field:

<form>
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
</form>
The step Attribute
The input step attribute specifies the legal number intervals for an input field.

Example: if step="3", legal numbers could be -3, 0, 3, 6, etc.

Tip: This attribute can be used together with the max and min attributes to create a range of legal values.

The step attribute works with the following input types: number, range, date, datetime-local, month, time and week.

Example
An input field with a specified legal number intervals:

<form>
  <label for="points">Points:</label>
  <input type="number" id="points" name="points" step="3">
</form>
Note: Input restrictions are not foolproof, and JavaScript provides many ways to add illegal input. To safely restrict input, it must also be checked by the receiver (the server)!

The autofocus Attribute
The input autofocus attribute specifies that an input field should automatically get focus when the page loads.

Example
Let the "First name" input field automatically get focus when the page loads:

<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" autofocus><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
</form>
The height and width Attributes
The input height and width attributes specify the height and width of an <input type="image"> element.

Tip: Always specify both the height and width attributes for images. If height and width are set, the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded. Without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. The effect will be that the page layout will change during loading (while the images load).

Example
Define an image as the submit button, with height and width attributes:

<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
  <input type="image" src="img_submit.gif" alt="Submit" width="48" height="48">
</form>
The list Attribute
The input list attribute refers to a <datalist> element that contains pre-defined options for an <input> element.

Example
An <input> element with pre-defined values in a <datalist>:

<form>
  <input list="browsers">
  <datalist id="browsers">
    <option value="Internet Explorer">
    <option value="Firefox">
    <option value="Chrome">
    <option value="Opera">
    <option value="Safari">
  </datalist>
</form>
The autocomplete Attribute
The input autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form or an input field should have autocomplete on or off.

Autocomplete allows the browser to predict the value. When a user starts to type in a field, the browser should display options to fill in the field, based on earlier typed values.

The autocomplete attribute works with <form> and the following <input> types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, datepickers, range, and color.

Example
An HTML form with autocomplete on, and off for one input field:

<form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" autocomplete="off"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
Tip: In some browsers you may need to activate an autocomplete function for this to work (Look under "Preferences" in the browser's menu).

              (44) HTML Input form* Attributes
This chapter describes the different form* attributes for the HTML <input> element.

The form Attribute
The input form attribute specifies the form the <input> element belongs to.

The value of this attribute must be equal to the id attribute of the <form> element it belongs to.

Example
An input field located outside of the HTML form (but still a part of the form):

<form action="/action_page.php" id="form1">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

<label for="lname">Last name:</label>
<input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" form="form1">
The formaction Attribute
The input formaction attribute specifies the URL of the file that will process the input when the form is submitted.

Note: This attribute overrides the action attribute of the <form> element.

The formaction attribute works with the following input types: submit and image.

Example
An HTML form with two submit buttons, with different actions:

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  <input type="submit" formaction="/action_page2.php" value="Submit as Admin">
</form>
The formenctype Attribute
The input formenctype attribute specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitted (only for forms with method="post").

Note: This attribute overrides the enctype attribute of the <form> element.

The formenctype attribute works with the following input types: submit and image.

Example
A form with two submit buttons. The first sends the form-data with default encoding, the second sends the form-data encoded as "multipart/form-data":

<form action="/action_page_binary.asp" method="post">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  <input type="submit" formenctype="multipart/form-data"
  value="Submit as Multipart/form-data">
</form>

The formmethod Attribute
The input formmethod attribute defines the HTTP method for sending form-data to the action URL.

Note: This attribute overrides the method attribute of the <form> element.

The formmethod attribute works with the following input types: submit and image.

The form-data can be sent as URL variables (method="get") or as an HTTP post transaction (method="post").

Notes on the "get" method:

This method appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs
This method is useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark the result
There is a limit to how much data you can place in a URL (varies between browsers), therefore, you cannot be sure that all of the form-data will be correctly transferred
Never use the "get" method to pass sensitive information! (password or other sensitive information will be visible in the browser's address bar)
Notes on the "post" method:

This method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction
Form submissions with the "post" method cannot be bookmarked
The "post" method is more robust and secure than "get", and "post" does not have size limitations
Example
A form with two submit buttons. The first sends the form-data with method="get". The second sends the form-data with method="post":

<form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit using GET">
  <input type="submit" formmethod="post" value="Submit using POST">
</form>
The formtarget Attribute
The input formtarget attribute specifies a name or a keyword that indicates where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.

Note: This attribute overrides the target attribute of the <form> element.

The formtarget attribute works with the following input types: submit and image.

Example
A form with two submit buttons, with different target windows:

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  <input type="submit" formtarget="_blank" value="Submit to a new window/tab">
</form>
The formnovalidate Attribute
The input formnovalidate attribute specifies that an <input> element should not be validated when submitted.

Note: This attribute overrides the novalidate attribute of the <form> element.

The formnovalidate attribute works with the following input types: submit.

Example
A form with two submit buttons (with and without validation):

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="email">Enter your email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  <input type="submit" formnovalidate="formnovalidate"
  value="Submit without validation">
</form>
The novalidate Attribute
The novalidate attribute is a <form> attribute.

When present, novalidate specifies that all of the form-data should not be validated when submitted.

Example
Specify that no form-data should be validated on submit:

<form action="/action_page.php" novalidate>
  <label for="email">Enter your email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

          (45) HTML Canvas Graphics
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page.

The graphic to the left is created with <canvas>. It shows four elements: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle, a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text.

What is HTML Canvas?
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

Browser Support
The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the <canvas> element.

Element					
<canvas>	4.0	9.0	2.0	3.1	9.0
Canvas Examples
A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content.

The markup looks like this:

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
Note: Always specify an id attribute (to be referred to in a script), and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas. To add a border, use the style attribute.

Here is an example of a basic, empty canvas:

Example
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
</canvas>
ADVERTISEMENT

Add a JavaScript
After creating the rectangular canvas area, you must add a JavaScript to do the drawing.

Here are some examples:

Draw a Line
Example
<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
ctx.lineTo(200, 100);
ctx.stroke();
</script>
Draw a Circle
Example
<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(95, 50, 40, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
ctx.stroke();
</script>
Draw a Text
Example
<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.font = "30px Arial";
ctx.fillText("Hello World", 10, 50);
</script>
Stroke Text
Example
<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.font = "30px Arial";
ctx.strokeText("Hello World", 10, 50);
</script>
Draw Linear Gradient
Example
<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");

// Create gradient
var grd = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 200, 0);
grd.addColorStop(0, "red");
grd.addColorStop(1, "white");

// Fill with gradient
ctx.fillStyle = grd;
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 80);
</script>
Draw Circular Gradient
Example
<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");

// Create gradient
var grd = ctx.createRadialGradient(75, 50, 5, 90, 60, 100);
grd.addColorStop(0, "red");
grd.addColorStop(1, "white");

// Fill with gradient
ctx.fillStyle = grd;
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 80);
</script>
Draw Image
<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
var img = document.getElementById("scream");
ctx.drawImage(img, 10, 10);
</script>

Differences Between SVG and Canvas
SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.

Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).

SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.

In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.

Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.

Comparison of Canvas and SVG
The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG:

Canvas	SVG
Resolution dependent
No support for event handlers
Poor text rendering capabilities
You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
Well suited for graphic-intensive games
Resolution independent
Support for event handlers
Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
Not suited for game applications

            (47) HTML Multimedia
Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations.

What is Multimedia?
Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, like images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.

Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats.

Browser Support
The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color.

Later came browsers with support for colors, fonts, images, and multimedia!

Multimedia Formats
Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files.

The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension.

Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.

Common Video Formats
Videoformats	There are many video formats out there.

The MP4, WebM, and Ogg formats are supported by HTML.

The MP4 format is recommended by YouTube.

Format	File	Description
MPEG	.mpg
.mpeg	MPEG. Developed by the Moving Pictures Expert Group. The first popular video format on the web. Not supported anymore in HTML.
AVI	.avi	AVI (Audio Video Interleave). Developed by Microsoft. Commonly used in video cameras and TV hardware. Plays well on Windows computers, but not in web browsers.
WMV	.wmv	WMV (Windows Media Video). Developed by Microsoft. Commonly used in video cameras and TV hardware. Plays well on Windows computers, but not in web browsers.
QuickTime	.mov	QuickTime. Developed by Apple. Commonly used in video cameras and TV hardware. Plays well on Apple computers, but not in web browsers.
RealVideo	.rm
.ram	RealVideo. Developed by Real Media to allow video streaming with low bandwidths. Does not play in web browsers.

          (48) HTML Video
The HTML <video> element is used to show a video on a web page.

Example

The HTML <video> Element
To show a video in HTML, use the <video> element:

Example
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
How it Works
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.

HTML <video> Autoplay
To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute:

Example
<video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted):

Example
<video width="320" height="240" autoplay muted>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

          (50) HTML Plug-ins
Plug-ins are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of the browser.

Plug-ins
Plug-ins were designed to be used for many different purposes:

To run Java applets
To run Microsoft ActiveX controls
To display Flash movies
To display maps
To scan for viruses
To verify a bank id
Warning !

Most browsers no longer support Java Applets and Plug-ins.

ActiveX controls are no longer supported in any browsers.

The support for Shockwave Flash has also been turned off in modern browsers.

The <object> Element
The <object> element is supported by all browsers.

The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML:

Example
<object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>
Or images if you like:

Example
<object data="audi.jpeg"></object>
ADVERTISEMENT

The <embed> Element
The <embed> element is supported in all major browsers.

The <embed> element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

Web browsers have supported the <embed> element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5.

Example
<embed src="audi.jpeg">
Note that the <embed> element does not have a closing tag. It can not contain alternative text.

The <embed> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:

Example
<embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html">

              (51) HTML YouTube Videos
The easiest way to play videos in HTML, is to use YouTube.

Struggling with Video Formats?
Converting videos to different formats can be difficult and time-consuming.

An easier solution is to let YouTube play the videos in your web page.

YouTube Video Id
YouTube will display an id (like tgbNymZ7vqY), when you save (or play) a video.

You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code.

Playing a YouTube Video in HTML
To play your video on a web page, do the following:

Upload the video to YouTube
Take a note of the video id
Define an <iframe> element in your web page
Let the src attribute point to the video URL
Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)
Example
<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY">
</iframe>
YouTube Autoplay + Mute
You can let your video start playing automatically when a user visits the page, by adding autoplay=1 to the YouTube URL. However, automatically starting a video is annoying for your visitors!

Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

Add mute=1 after autoplay=1 to let your video start playing automatically (but muted).

YouTube - Autoplay + Muted

YouTube Loop
Add loop=1 to let your video loop forever.

Value 0 (default): The video will play only once.

Value 1: The video will loop (forever).

YouTube - Loop
<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?playlist=tgbNymZ7vqY&loop=1">
</iframe>
YouTube Controls
Add controls=0 to not display controls in the video player.

Value 0: Player controls does not display.

Value 1 (default): Player controls display.

YouTube - Controls

                Publishing Your Website
To make your website available to the world, you must publish it.

For this, you have two options:

Use an Internet Service Provider
Host your own website
Using an Internet Service Provider
An Internet service provider (ISP) is a company that provides services for accessing and using the Internet.

Internet services typically provided by ISPs include Internet access, Internet transit, domain name registration, web hosting, Usenet service, and colocation.

Using an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is the most common option.

Advantages:
Connection Speed - ISPs have very fast connections to the internet.
Powerful Hardware - ISPs have powerful web servers that can be shared by several clients. You can also expect an effective load balancing and necessary backup servers
Security and Stability - ISPs are specialists on web hosting. Expect more than 99% up time, the latest software patches, and the best virus protection
Things to Consider:
24-hour support - The ISP should offer 24-hours support. Toll-free phone could also be vital
Daily Backup - The ISP must run a daily backup routine
Traffic Volume - Check the ISP's traffic volume restrictions (do not end up paying a fortune for unexpected high traffic)
Bandwidth or Content Restrictions - Check the ISP's bandwidth and content restrictions (Is it possible to publish pictures, video, or sound?)
E-mail Capabilities - Make sure the ISP supports the e-mail capabilities you need
Database Access - Make sure the ISP supports the database access you need
Hosting Your Own Website
Hosting your own website, on your own server, is also an option.

Things to Consider:
Hardware Expenses - To run a "real" web site, you must buy powerful server hardware (a low cost PC will not do the job). You will also need a permanent (24/7) high-speed connection
Software Expenses - Server-licenses are often higher than client-licenses. Server-licenses also might have limits on number of users
Labor Expenses - Don't expect low labor expenses. You have to install your own hardware and software. You also have to deal with bugs and viruses, and keep your server constantly running
