Why Use CSS?
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

CSS Solved a Big Problem
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

If you don't know what HTML is, we suggest that you read our HTML Tutorial.

CSS Saves a Lot of Work!
The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.

With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

                                                            
                                                  CSS Syntax

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

CSS Syntax
CSS selector

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

Example
In this example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:

p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}

Example Explained
p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
color is a property, and red is the property value
text-align is a property, and center is the property value
You will learn much more about CSS selectors and CSS properties in the next chapters!

                                        
                                                    CSS Selectors

A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

The CSS element Selector
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

Example
Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: 

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

Example
The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": 

#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
Note: An id name cannot start with a number!

The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

Example
In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

Example
In this example only <p> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

Example
In this example the <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large": 

<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
Note: A class name cannot start with a number!

The CSS Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

Example
The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: 

* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
The CSS Grouping Selector
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.

To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

Example
In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above: 

h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

Set the color of all <p> elements to red.

<style>
p
 {
  
color:
 red;
}
</style>

All CSS Simple Selectors
Selector	Example	Example description
#id	#firstname	Selects the element with id="firstname"
.class	.intro	Selects all elements with class="intro"
element.class	p.intro	Selects only <p> elements with class="intro"
*	*	Selects all elements
element	p	Selects all <p> elements
element,element,..	div, p	Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements

                                                How To Add CSS

When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.

Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS

External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

Example
External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

Here is how the "mystyle.css" file looks:

"mystyle.css"
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  margin-left: 20px;
}

Note: Do not add a space between the property value and the unit:
Incorrect (space): margin-left: 20 px;
Correct (nospace): margin-left: 20px;

Internal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

Example
Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
  background-color: linen;
}

h1 {
  color: maroon;
  margin-left: 40px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Example
Inline styles are defined within the "style" attribute of the relevant element:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
Tip: An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly.

Multiple Style Sheets
If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. 

Assume that an external style sheet has the following style for the <h1> element:

h1 {
  color: navy;
}
Then, assume that an internal style sheet also has the following style for the <h1> element:

h1 {
  color: orange;   
}
Example
If the internal style is defined after the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be "orange":

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
<style>
h1 {
  color: orange;
}
</style>
</head>
Example
However, if the internal style is defined before the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be "navy": 

<head>
<style>
h1 {
  color: orange;
}
</style>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
Cascading Order
What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

Inline style (inside an HTML element)
External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
Browser default
So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

CSS Comments
CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.

CSS Comments
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.

Comments are ignored by browsers.

A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:

Example
/* This is a single-line comment */
p {
  color: red;
}
You can add comments wherever you want in the code:

Example
p {
  color: red;  /* Set text color to red */
}
Comments can also span multiple lines: 

Example
/* This is
a multi-line
comment */

p {
  color: red;
}

                                        HTML and CSS Comments

From the HTML tutorial, you learned that you can add comments to your HTML source by using the <!--...--> syntax.

In the following example, we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p {
  color: red; /* Set text color to red */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>My Heading</h2>

<!-- These paragraphs will be red -->
<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>
<p>CSS comments are not shown in the output.</p>

</body>
</html>

                                            CSS Colors

Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.

CSS Color Names
In CSS, a color can be specified by using a predefined color name:

Tomato
Orange
DodgerBlue
MediumSeaGreen
Gray
SlateBlue
Violet
LightGray

CSS/HTML support 140 standard color names.

CSS Background Color
You can set the background color for HTML elements:

Hello World


Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat. Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Example
<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;">Lorem ipsum...</p>

CSS Text Color
You can set the color of text:

Hello World
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.

Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Example
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Lorem ipsum...</p>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Ut wisi enim...</p>

CSS Border Color
You can set the color of borders:

Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Example
<h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">Hello World</h1>
CSS Color Values
In CSS, colors can also be specified using RGB values, HEX values, HSL values, RGBA values, and HSLA values:

Same as color name "Tomato":

rgb(255, 99, 71)
#ff6347
hsl(9, 100%, 64%)
Same as color name "Tomato", but 50% transparent:

rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5)
Example
<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">...</h1>
Learn more about Color Values
You will learn more about RGB, HEX and HSL in the next chapters.

CSS RGB Colors
An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.

RGB Value
In CSS, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:

rgb(red, green, blue)

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.

For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).

To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).

Experiment by mixing the RGB values below:

rgb(250, 255, 255)

RED


250
GREEN


255
BLUE


255
Example
rgb(255, 0, 0)
rgb(0, 0, 255)
rgb(60, 179, 113)
rgb(238, 130, 238)
rgb(255, 165, 0)
rgb(106, 90, 205)

Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:

Example
rgb(60, 60, 60)
rgb(90, 90, 90)
rgb(120, 120, 120)
rgb(180, 180, 180)
rgb(210, 210, 210)
rgb(240, 240, 240)

RGBA Value
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with:

rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

Experiment by mixing the RGBA values below:

rgba(255, 170, 106, 0.9)

RED


255
GREEN


170
BLUE


106
ALPHA


0.9
Example
rgba(255, 99, 71, 0)
rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.2)
rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.4)
rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.6)
rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.8)
rgba(255, 99, 71, 1)

CSS HEX Colors
A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.

HEX Value
In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:

#rrggbb

Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).

For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).

To display black, set all values to 00, like this: #000000.

To display white, set all values to ff, like this: #ffffff.  

Experiment by mixing the HEX values below:

#ffce5a

RED


ff
GREEN


ce
BLUE


5a
Example
#ff0000
#0000ff
#3cb371
#ee82ee
#ffa500
#6a5acd

Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:

Example
#3c3c3c
#616161
#787878
#b4b4b4
#f0f0f0
#f9f9f9

3 Digit HEX Value
Sometimes you will see a 3-digit hex code in the CSS source.

The 3-digit hex code is a shorthand for some 6-digit hex codes.

The 3-digit hex code has the following form:

#rgb

Where r, g, and b represents the red, green, and blue components with values between 0 and f.

The 3-digit hex code can only be used when both the values (RR, GG, and BB) are the same for each components. So, if we have #ff00cc, it can be written like this: #f0c.

Here is an example:

Example
body {
  background-color: #fc9; /* same as #ffcc99 */
}

h1 {
  color: #f0f; /* same as #ff00ff */
}

p {
  color: #b58; /* same as #bb5588 */
}

CSS HSL Colors
HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.

HSL Value
In CSS, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white

Experiment by mixing the HSL values below:

hsl(0, 100%, 50%)

HUE


0
SATURATION


100%
LIGHTNESS


50%
Example
hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
hsl(147, 50%, 47%)
hsl(300, 76%, 72%)
hsl(39, 100%, 50%)
hsl(248, 53%, 58%)

Saturation
Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.

100% is pure color, no shades of gray

50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.

0% is completely gray, you can no longer see the color.

Example
hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
hsl(0, 80%, 50%)
hsl(0, 60%, 50%)
hsl(0, 40%, 50%)
hsl(0, 20%, 50%)
hsl(0, 0%, 50%)

Lightness
The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light) 100% means full lightness (white).

Example
hsl(0, 100%, 0%)
hsl(0, 100%, 25%)
hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
hsl(0, 100%, 75%)
hsl(0, 100%, 90%)
hsl(0, 100%, 100%)

Shades of Gray
Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjust the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades:

Example
hsl(0, 0%, 0%)
hsl(0, 0%, 24%)
hsl(0, 0%, 47%)
hsl(0, 0%, 71%)
hsl(0, 0%, 94%)
hsl(0, 0%, 100%)

HSLA Value
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An HSLA color value is specified with:

hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

Experiment by mixing the HSLA values below:

hsla(0, 100%, 43%, 0.3)

HUE


0
SATURATION


100%
LIGHTNESS


43%
ALPHA


0.3
Example
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.2)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.4)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.6)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.8)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 1)

                                    CSS Backgrounds

The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.

In these chapters, you will learn about the following CSS background properties:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
background (shorthand property)

CSS background-color
The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.

Example
The background color of a page is set like this:

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
With CSS, a color is most often specified by:

a valid color name - like "red"
a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

Other Elements
You can set the background color for any HTML elements:

Example
Here, the <h1>, <p>, and <div> elements will have different background colors: 

h1 {
  background-color: green;
}

div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

Opacity / Transparency
The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element. It can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower value, the more transparent:

opacity 1

opacity 0.6

opacity 0.3

opacity 0.1

Example
div {
  background-color: green;
  opacity: 0.3;
}
Note: When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, all of its child elements inherit the same transparency. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read.

Transparency using RGBA
If you do not want to apply opacity to child elements, like in our example above, use RGBA color values. The following example sets the opacity for the background color and not the text:

100% opacity

60% opacity

30% opacity

10% opacity

You learned from our CSS Colors Chapter, that you can use RGB as a color value. In addition to RGB, you can use an RGB color value with an alpha channel (RGBA) - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha). The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).

Note: RGBA is used to add opacity to text!

Tip: You will learn more about RGBA Colors in our CSS Colors Chapter.

Example
div {
  background: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.3) /* Green background with 30% opacity */
}
The CSS Background Color Property
Property	Description
background-color	Sets the background color of an element

CSS Background Image
CSS background-image
The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

Example
Set the background image for a page: 

body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}
Example
This example shows a bad combination of text and background image. The text is hardly readable: 

body {
  background-image: url("bgdesert.jpg");
}
Note: When using a background image, use an image that does not disturb the text.

The background image can also be set for specific elements, like the <p> element:

Example
p {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}
The CSS Background Image Property
Property	Description
background-image	Sets the background image for an element

CSS Background Image Repeat
CSS background-repeat
By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.

Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange, like this:

Example
body {
  background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
}
If the image above is repeated only horizontally (background-repeat: repeat-x;), the background will look better:

Example
body {
  background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
}
Tip: To repeat an image vertically, set background-repeat: repeat-y;

CSS background-repeat: no-repeat
Showing the background image only once is also specified by the background-repeat property:

Example
Show the background image only once:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
In the example above, the background image is placed in the same place as the text. We want to change the position of the image, so that it does not disturb the text too much.

CSS background-position
The background-position property is used to specify the position of the background image.

Example
Position the background image in the top-right corner: 

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}
The CSS Background Repeat and Position Properties
Property	Description
background-position	Sets the starting position of a background image
background-repeat	Sets how a background image will be repeated

CSS Background Attachment
CSS background-attachment
The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page):

Example
Specify that the background image should be fixed:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}
Example
Specify that the background image should scroll with the rest of the page:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
  background-attachment: scroll;
}
The CSS Background Attachment Property
Property	Description
background-attachment	Sets whether a background image is fixed or scrolls with the rest of the page

CSS Background Shorthand
CSS background - Shorthand property
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

Instead of writing:

body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}
You can use the shorthand property background:

Example
Use the shorthand property to set the background properties in one declaration:

body {
  background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
}
When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. Note that we do not use the background-attachment property in the examples above, as it does not have a value.

CSS Borders
The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.

I have borders on all sides.


I have a red bottom border.


I have rounded borders.


I have a blue left border.

CSS Border Style
The border-style property specifies what kind of border to display.

The following values are allowed:

dotted - Defines a dotted border
dashed - Defines a dashed border
solid - Defines a solid border
double - Defines a double border
groove - Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border-color value
ridge - Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border-color value
inset - Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
outset - Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
none - Defines no border
hidden - Defines a hidden border
The border-style property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).

Example
Demonstration of the different border styles:

p.dotted {border-style: dotted;}
p.dashed {border-style: dashed;}
p.solid {border-style: solid;}
p.double {border-style: double;}
p.groove {border-style: groove;}
p.ridge {border-style: ridge;}
p.inset {border-style: inset;}
p.outset {border-style: outset;}
p.none {border-style: none;}
p.hidden {border-style: hidden;}
p.mix {border-style: dotted dashed solid double;}
Result:

A dotted border.

A dashed border.

A solid border.

A double border.

A groove border. The effect depends on the border-color value.

A ridge border. The effect depends on the border-color value.

An inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value.

An outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value.

No border.

A hidden border.

A mixed border.

Note: None of the OTHER CSS border properties (which you will learn more about in the next chapters) will have ANY effect unless the border-style property is set!

CSS Border Width
CSS Border Width
The border-width property specifies the width of the four borders.

The width can be set as a specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc) or by using one of the three pre-defined values: thin, medium, or thick:

Example
Demonstration of the different border widths:

p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 5px;
}

p.two {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: medium;
}

p.three {
  border-style: dotted;
  border-width: 2px;
}

p.four {
  border-style: dotted;
  border-width: thick;
}
Result:

5px border-width
medium border-width
2px border-width
thick border-width

Specific Side Widths
The border-width property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border):

Example
p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 5px 20px; /* 5px top and bottom, 20px on the sides */
}

p.two {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 20px 5px; /* 20px top and bottom, 5px on the sides */
}

p.three {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 25px 10px 4px 35px; /* 25px top, 10px right, 4px bottom and 35px left */
}

              /*  CHAPTER 2  ************************************************************************************************** */

                                      Continuation on border

CSS Border Color
CSS Border Color
The border-color property is used to set the color of the four borders.

The color can be set by:

name - specify a color name, like "red"
HEX - specify a HEX value, like "#ff0000"
RGB - specify a RGB value, like "rgb(255,0,0)"
HSL - specify a HSL value, like "hsl(0, 100%, 50%)"
transparent
Note: If border-color is not set, it inherits the color of the element.

Example
Demonstration of the different border colors:

p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: red;
}

p.two {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: green;
}

p.three {
  border-style: dotted;
  border-color: blue;
}
Result:

Red border
Green border
Blue border
Specific Side Colors
The border-color property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border). 

Example
p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: red green blue yellow; /* red top, green right, blue bottom and yellow left */
}

HEX Values
The color of the border can also be specified using a hexadecimal value (HEX):

Example
p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: #ff0000; /* red */
}
RGB Values
Or by using RGB values:

Example
p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: rgb(255, 0, 0); /* red */
}
HSL Values
You can also use HSL values:

Example
p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); /* red */
}
You can learn more about HEX, RGB and HSL values in our CSS Colors chapters.

CSS Border Sides
CSS Border - Individual Sides
From the examples on the previous pages, you have seen that it is possible to specify a different border for each side.

In CSS, there are also properties for specifying each of the borders (top, right, bottom, and left):

Example
p {
  border-top-style: dotted;
  border-right-style: solid;
  border-bottom-style: dotted;
  border-left-style: solid;
}
Result:

Different Border Styles
The example above gives the same result as this:

Example
p {
  border-style: dotted solid;
}
So, here is how it works:

If the border-style property has four values:

border-style: dotted solid double dashed;
top border is dotted
right border is solid
bottom border is double
left border is dashed
If the border-style property has three values:

border-style: dotted solid double;
top border is dotted
right and left borders are solid
bottom border is double
If the border-style property has two values:

border-style: dotted solid;
top and bottom borders are dotted
right and left borders are solid
If the border-style property has one value:

border-style: dotted;
all four borders are dotted
Example
/* Four values */
p {
  border-style: dotted solid double dashed;
}

/* Three values */
p {
  border-style: dotted solid double;
}

/* Two values */
p {
  border-style: dotted solid;
}

/* One value */
p {
  border-style: dotted;
}
The border-style property is used in the example above. However, it also works with border-width and border-color.

CSS Shorthand Border Property
CSS Border - Shorthand Property
Like you saw in the previous page, there are many properties to consider when dealing with borders.

To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the individual border properties in one property.

The border property is a shorthand property for the following individual border properties:

border-width
border-style (required)
border-color
Example
p {
  border: 5px solid red;
}
Result:

Some text

You can also specify all the individual border properties for just one side:

Left Border
p {
  border-left: 6px solid red;
}
Result:

Some text

Bottom Border
p {
  border-bottom: 6px solid red;
}
Result:

Some text

CSS Rounded Borders
CSS Rounded Borders
The border-radius property is used to add rounded borders to an element:

Normal border

Round border

Rounder border

Roundest border

Example
p {
  border: 2px solid red;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

                              CSS Margins

Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

This element has a margin of 70px.
CSS Margins
The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

Margin - Individual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
All the margin properties can have the following values:

auto - the browser calculates the margin
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element
Tip: Negative values are allowed.

Example
Set different margins for all four sides of a <p> element:

p {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
}

Margin - Shorthand Property
To shorten the code, it is possible to specify all the margin properties in one property.

The margin property is a shorthand property for the following individual margin properties:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
So, here is how it works:

If the margin property has four values:

margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
top margin is 25px
right margin is 50px
bottom margin is 75px
left margin is 100px
Example
Use the margin shorthand property with four values:

p {
  margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
}
If the margin property has three values:

margin: 25px 50px 75px;
top margin is 25px
right and left margins are 50px
bottom margin is 75px
Example
Use the margin shorthand property with three values: 

p {
  margin: 25px 50px 75px;
}
If the margin property has two values:

margin: 25px 50px;
top and bottom margins are 25px
right and left margins are 50px
Example
Use the margin shorthand property with two values: 

p {
  margin: 25px 50px;
}
If the margin property has one value:

margin: 25px;
all four margins are 25px
Example
Use the margin shorthand property with one value: 

p {
  margin: 25px;
}
The auto Value
You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.

The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins.

Example
Use margin: auto:

div {
  width: 300px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
The inherit Value
This example lets the left margin of the <p class="ex1"> element be inherited from the parent element (<div>):

Example
Use of the inherit value:

div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  margin-left: 100px;
}

p.ex1 {
  margin-left: inherit;
}
All CSS Margin Properties
Property	Description
margin	A shorthand property for setting all the margin properties in one declaration
margin-bottom	Sets the bottom margin of an element
margin-left	Sets the left margin of an element
margin-right	Sets the right margin of an element
margin-top	Sets the top margin of an element

CSS Margin Collapse
Sometimes two margins collapse into a single margin.

Margin Collapse
Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.

This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!

Look at the following example:

Example
Demonstration of margin collapse:

h1 {
  margin: 0 0 50px 0;
}

h2 {
  margin: 20px 0 0 0;
}
In the example above, the <h1> element has a bottom margin of 50px and the <h2> element has a top margin set to 20px.

Common sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the <h1> and the <h2> would be a total of 70px (50px + 20px). But due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px.

                                      CSS Padding

Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

This element has a padding of 70px.

CSS Padding
The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

Padding - Individual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the padding for each side of an element:

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
All the padding properties can have the following values:

length - specifies a padding in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a padding in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the padding should be inherited from the parent element
Note: Negative values are not allowed.

Example
Set different padding for all four sides of a <div> element:  

div {
  padding-top: 50px;
  padding-right: 30px;
  padding-bottom: 50px;
  padding-left: 80px;
}

Padding - Shorthand Property
To shorten the code, it is possible to specify all the padding properties in one property.

The padding property is a shorthand property for the following individual padding properties:

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
So, here is how it works:

If the padding property has four values:

padding: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
top padding is 25px
right padding is 50px
bottom padding is 75px
left padding is 100px
Example
Use the padding shorthand property with four values:

div {
  padding: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
}
If the padding property has three values:

padding: 25px 50px 75px;
top padding is 25px
right and left paddings are 50px
bottom padding is 75px
Example
Use the padding shorthand property with three values: 

div {
  padding: 25px 50px 75px;
}
If the padding property has two values:

padding: 25px 50px;
top and bottom paddings are 25px
right and left paddings are 50px
Example
Use the padding shorthand property with two values: 

div {
  padding: 25px 50px;
}
If the padding property has one value:

padding: 25px;
all four paddings are 25px
Example
Use the padding shorthand property with one value: 

div {
  padding: 25px;
}
Padding and Element Width
The CSS width property specifies the width of the element's content area. The content area is the portion inside the padding, border, and margin of an element (the box model).

So, if an element has a specified width, the padding added to that element will be added to the total width of the element. This is often an undesirable result.

Example
Here, the <div> element is given a width of 300px. However, the actual width of the <div> element will be 350px (300px + 25px of left padding + 25px of right padding):

div {
  width: 300px;
  padding: 25px;
}
To keep the width at 300px, no matter the amount of padding, you can use the box-sizing property. This causes the element to maintain its actual width; if you increase the padding, the available content space will decrease.

Example
Use the box-sizing property to keep the width at 300px, no matter the amount of padding:

div {
  width: 300px;
  padding: 25px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

                                          CSS Height, Width and Max-width

The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

The CSS max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

This element has a height of 50 pixels and a width of 100%.

CSS Setting height and width
The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.

CSS height and width Values
The height and width properties may have the following values:

auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
length - Defines the height/width in px, cm etc.
% - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value
CSS height and width Examples
This element has a height of 200 pixels and a width of 50%
Example
Set the height and width of a <div> element:

div {
  height: 200px;
  width: 50%;
  background-color: powderblue;
}

This element has a height of 100 pixels and a width of 500 pixels.
Example
Set the height and width of another <div> element:

div {
  height: 100px;
  width: 500px;
  background-color: powderblue;
}

Note: Remember that the height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins! They set the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element!

Setting max-width
The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).

The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.

Tip: Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference between the two divs!

This element has a height of 100 pixels and a max-width of 500 pixels.
Note: If you for some reason use both the width property and the max-width property on the same element, and the value of the width property is larger than the max-width property; the max-width property will be used (and the width property will be ignored).

Example
This <div> element has a height of 100 pixels and a max-width of 500 pixels: 

div {
  max-width: 500px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: powderblue;
}

                                              CSS Box Model

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.

The CSS Box Model
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 

Example
Demonstration of the box model:

div {
  width: 300px;
  border: 15px solid green;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 20px;
}

Width and Height of an Element
In order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to know how the box model works.

Important: When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.

Example
This <div> element will have a total width of 350px: 

div {
  width: 320px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid gray;
  margin: 0;
}
Here is the calculation:
320px (width)
+ 20px (left + right padding)
+ 10px (left + right border)
+ 0px (left + right margin)
= 350px
The total width of an element should be calculated like this:

Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin

The total height of an element should be calculated like this:

Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin

                                                  CSS Outline

An outline is a line drawn outside the element's border.

This element has a black border and a green outline with a width of 10px.

CSS Outline
An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".

CSS has the following outline properties:

outline-style
outline-color
outline-width
outline-offset
outline
Note: Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

CSS Outline Style
The outline-style property specifies the style of the outline, and can have one of the following values:

dotted - Defines a dotted outline
dashed - Defines a dashed outline
solid - Defines a solid outline
double - Defines a double outline
groove - Defines a 3D grooved outline
ridge - Defines a 3D ridged outline
inset - Defines a 3D inset outline
outset - Defines a 3D outset outline
none - Defines no outline
hidden - Defines a hidden outline
The following example shows the different outline-style values:

Example
Demonstration of the different outline styles:

p.dotted {outline-style: dotted;}
p.dashed {outline-style: dashed;}
p.solid {outline-style: solid;}
p.double {outline-style: double;}
p.groove {outline-style: groove;}
p.ridge {outline-style: ridge;}
p.inset {outline-style: inset;}
p.outset {outline-style: outset;}
Result:

A dotted outline.

A dashed outline.

A solid outline.

A double outline.

A groove outline. The effect depends on the outline-color value.

A ridge outline. The effect depends on the outline-color value.

An inset outline. The effect depends on the outline-color value.

An outset outline. The effect depends on the outline-color value.

Note: None of the other outline properties (which you will learn more about in the next chapters) will have ANY effect unless the outline-style property is set!

CSS Outline Width
CSS Outline Width
The outline-width property specifies the width of the outline, and can have one of the following values:

thin (typically 1px)
medium (typically 3px)
thick (typically 5px)
A specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc)
The following example shows some outlines with different widths:

A thin outline.

A medium outline.

A thick outline.

A 4px thick outline.

Example
p.ex1 {
  border: 1px solid black;
  outline-style: solid;
  outline-color: red;
  outline-width: thin;
}

p.ex2 {
  border: 1px solid black;
  outline-style: solid;
  outline-color: red;
  outline-width: medium;
}

p.ex3 {
  border: 1px solid black;
  outline-style: solid;
  outline-color: red;
  outline-width: thick;
}

p.ex4 {
  border: 1px solid black;
  outline-style: solid;
  outline-color: red;
  outline-width: 4px;
}

CSS Outline Color
CSS Outline Color
The outline-color property is used to set the color of the outline.

The color can be set by:

name - specify a color name, like "red"
HEX - specify a hex value, like "#ff0000"
RGB - specify a RGB value, like "rgb(255,0,0)"
HSL - specify a HSL value, like "hsl(0, 100%, 50%)"
invert - performs a color inversion (which ensures that the outline is visible, regardless of color background)
The following example shows some different outlines with different colors. Also notice that these elements also have a thin black border inside the outline:

A solid red outline.

A dotted blue outline.

An outset grey outline.

Example
p.ex1 {
  border: 2px solid black;
  outline-style: solid;
  outline-color: red;
}

p.ex2 {
  border: 2px solid black;
  outline-style: dotted;
  outline-color: blue;
}

p.ex3 {
  border: 2px solid black;
  outline-style: outset;
  outline-color: grey;
}
HEX Values
The outline color can also be specified using a hexadecimal value (HEX):

Example
p.ex1 {
  outline-style: solid;
  outline-color: #ff0000; /* red */
}

RGB Values
Or by using RGB values:

Example
p.ex1 {
  outline-style: solid;
  outline-color: rgb(255, 0, 0); /* red */
}
HSL Values
You can also use HSL values:

Example
p.ex1 {
  outline-style: solid;
  outline-color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); /* red */
}

CSS Outline Shorthand
CSS Outline - Shorthand property
The outline property is a shorthand property for setting the following individual outline properties:

outline-width
outline-style (required)
outline-color
The outline property is specified as one, two, or three values from the list above. The order of the values does not matter.

The following example shows some outlines specified with the shorthand outline property:

A dashed outline.

A dotted red outline.

A 5px solid yellow outline.

A thick ridge pink outline.

Example
p.ex1 {outline: dashed;}
p.ex2 {outline: dotted red;}
p.ex3 {outline: 5px solid yellow;}
p.ex4 {outline: thick ridge pink;}

CSS Outline Offset
CSS Outline Offset
The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element. The space between an element and its outline is transparent.

The following example specifies an outline 15px outside the border edge:

This paragraph has an outline 15px outside the border edge.

Example
p {
  margin: 30px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  outline: 1px solid red;
  outline-offset: 15px;
}

Example
p {
  margin: 30px;
  background: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
  outline: 1px solid red;
  outline-offset: 15px;
}

                                              CSS Text

CSS has a lot of properties for formatting text.

TEXT FORMATTING
This text is styled with some of the text formatting properties. The heading uses the text-align, text-transform, and color properties. The paragraph is indented, aligned, and the space between characters is specified. The underline is removed from this colored "Try it Yourself" link.

Text Color
The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:

a color name - like "red"
a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.

Example
body {
  color: blue;
}

h1 {
  color: green;
}
Text Color and Background Color
In this example, we define both the background-color property and the color property:

Example
body {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  color: blue;
}

h1 {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}

div {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
Important: High contrast is very important for people with vision problems. So, always ensure that the contrast between the text color and the background color (or background image) is good!

The CSS Text Color Property
Property	Description
color	Specifies the color of text

CSS Text Alignment
CSS Text Alignment and Text Direction
In this chapter you will learn about the following properties:

text-align
text-align-last
direction
unicode-bidi
vertical-align
Text Alignment
The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.

A text can be left or right aligned, centered, or justified.

The following example shows center aligned, and left and right aligned text (left alignment is default if text direction is left-to-right, and right alignment is default if text direction is right-to-left):

Example
h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

h2 {
  text-align: left;
}

h3 {
  text-align: right;
}
When the text-align property is set to "justify", each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, and the left and right margins are straight (like in magazines and newspapers):

Example
div {
  text-align: justify;
}
Text Align Last
The text-align-last property specifies how to align the last line of a text.

Example
Align the last line of text in three <p> elements:

p.a {
  text-align-last: right;
}

p.b {
  text-align-last: center;
}

p.c {
  text-align-last: justify;
}

Text Direction
The direction and unicode-bidi properties can be used to change the text direction of an element:

Example
p {
  direction: rtl;
  unicode-bidi: bidi-override;
}

Vertical Alignment
The vertical-align property sets the vertical alignment of an element.

Example
Set the vertical alignment of an image in a text: 

img.a {
  vertical-align: baseline;
}

img.b {
  vertical-align: text-top;
}

img.c {
  vertical-align: text-bottom;
}

img.d {
  vertical-align: sub;
}

img.e {
  vertical-align: super;
}

The CSS Text Alignment/Direction Properties
Property	Description
direction	Specifies the text direction/writing direction
text-align	Specifies the horizontal alignment of text
text-align-last	Specifies how to align the last line of a text
unicode-bidi	Used together with the direction property to set or return whether the text should be overridden to support multiple languages in the same document
vertical-align	Sets the vertical alignment of an element

CSS Text Decoration
CSS Text Decoration
In this chapter you will learn about the following properties:

text-decoration-line
text-decoration-color
text-decoration-style
text-decoration-thickness
text-decoration
Add a Decoration Line to Text
The text-decoration-line property is used to add a decoration line to text.

Tip: You can combine more than one value, like overline and underline to display lines both over and under a text.

Example
h1 {
  text-decoration-line: overline;
}

h2 {
  text-decoration-line: line-through;
}

h3 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
}

p {
  text-decoration-line: overline underline;
}
Note: It is not recommended to underline text that is not a link, as this often confuses the reader.

Specify a Color for the Decoration Line
The text-decoration-color property is used to set the color of the decoration line.

Example
h1 {
  text-decoration-line: overline;
  text-decoration-color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-decoration-line: line-through;
  text-decoration-color: blue;
}

h3 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-color: green;
}

p {
  text-decoration-line: overline underline;
  text-decoration-color: purple;
}

Specify a Style for the Decoration Line
The text-decoration-style property is used to set the style of the decoration line.

Example
h1 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-style: solid;
}

h2 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-style: double;
}

h3 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-style: dotted;
}

p.ex1 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-style: dashed;
}

p.ex2 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-style: wavy;
}

p.ex3 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-color: red;
  text-decoration-style: wavy;
}
Specify the Thickness for the Decoration Line
The text-decoration-thickness property is used to set the thickness of the decoration line.

Example
h1 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-thickness: auto;
}

h2 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-thickness: 5px;
}

h3 {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-thickness: 25%;
}

p {
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-color: red;
  text-decoration-style: double;
  text-decoration-thickness: 5px;
}

The Shorthand Property
The text-decoration property is a shorthand property for:

text-decoration-line (required)
text-decoration-color (optional)
text-decoration-style (optional)
text-decoration-thickness (optional)
Example
h1 {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

h2 {
  text-decoration: underline red;
}

h3 {
  text-decoration: underline red double;
}

p {
  text-decoration: underline red double 5px;
}

A Small Tip
All links in HTML are underlined by default. Sometimes you see that links are styled with no underline. The text-decoration: none; is used to remove the underline from links, like this:

Example
a {
  text-decoration: none;
}

All CSS text-decoration Properties
Property	Description
text-decoration	Sets all the text-decoration properties in one declaration
text-decoration-color	Specifies the color of the text-decoration
text-decoration-line	Specifies the kind of text decoration to be used (underline, overline, etc.)
text-decoration-style	Specifies the style of the text decoration (solid, dotted, etc.)
text-decoration-thickness	Specifies the thickness of the text decoration line

CSS Text Transformation
Text Transformation
The text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.

It can be used to turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalize the first letter of each word:

Example
p.uppercase {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

p.lowercase {
  text-transform: lowercase;
}

p.capitalize {
  text-transform: capitalize;
}

The CSS Text Transformation Property
Property	Description
text-transform	Controls the capitalization of text

CSS Text Spacing
CSS Text Indentation, Letter Spacing, Line Height, Word Spacing, and White Space
In this chapter you will learn about the following properties:

text-indent
letter-spacing
line-height
word-spacing
white-space

Text Indentation
The text-indent property is used to specify the indentation of the first line of a text:

Example
p {
  text-indent: 50px;
}
Letter Spacing
The letter-spacing property is used to specify the space between the characters in a text.

The following example demonstrates how to increase or decrease the space between characters:

Example
h1 {
  letter-spacing: 5px;
}

h2 {
  letter-spacing: -2px;
}
Line Height
The line-height property is used to specify the space between lines:

Example
p.small {
  line-height: 0.8;
}

p.big {
  line-height: 1.8;
}

Word Spacing
The word-spacing property is used to specify the space between the words in a text.

The following example demonstrates how to increase or decrease the space between words:

Example
p.one {
  word-spacing: 10px;
}

p.two {
  word-spacing: -2px;
}
White Space
The white-space property specifies how white-space inside an element is handled.

This example demonstrates how to disable text wrapping inside an element:

Example
p {
  white-space: nowrap;
}
The CSS Text Spacing Properties
Property	Description
letter-spacing	Specifies the space between characters in a text
line-height	Specifies the line height
text-indent	Specifies the indentation of the first line in a text-block
white-space	Specifies how to handle white-space inside an element
word-spacing	Specifies the space between words in a text

CSS Text Shadow
Text Shadow
The text-shadow property adds shadow to text.

In its simplest use, you only specify the horizontal shadow (2px) and the vertical shadow (2px):

Text shadow effect!
Example
h1 {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px;
}
Next, add a color (red) to the shadow:

Text shadow effect!
Example
h1 {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px red;
}
Then, add a blur effect (5px) to the shadow:

Text shadow effect!
Example
h1 {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red;
}
More Text Shadow Examples
Example 1
Text-shadow on a white text:

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;
}
Example 2
Text-shadow with red neon glow:

h1 {
  text-shadow: 0 0 3px #ff0000;
}
Example 3
Text-shadow with red and blue neon glow:

h1 {
  text-shadow: 0 0 3px #ff0000, 0 0 5px #0000ff;
}
Example 4
h1 {
  color: white;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black, 0 0 25px blue, 0 0 5px darkblue;
}

Choosing the right font for your website is important!

Font Selection is Important
Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a website.

The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.

Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font.

Generic Font Families
In CSS there are five generic font families:

Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families. 

Difference Between Serif and Sans-serif Fonts
Serif vs. Sans-serif
Note: On computer screens, sans-serif fonts are considered easier to read than serif fonts.

Some Font Examples
Generic Font Family	Examples of Font Names
Serif	Times New Roman
Georgia
Garamond
Sans-serif	Arial
Verdana
Helvetica
Monospace	Courier New
Lucida Console

Cursive	Brush Script MT
Lucida Handwriting
Fantasy	Copperplate
Papyrus

The CSS font-family Property
In CSS, we use the font-family property to specify the font of a text.

Note: If the font name is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".

Tip: The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available). The font names should be separated with comma. Read more about fallback fonts in the next chapter.

Example
Specify some different fonts for three paragraphs:

.p1 {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}

.p2 {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

.p3 {
  font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;
}

CSS Web Safe Fonts
What are Web Safe Fonts?
Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.

Fallback Fonts
However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is always a chance that a font is not found or is not installed properly.

Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts.

This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in the font-family property. If the first font does not work, the browser will try the next one, and the next one, and so on. Always end the list with a generic font family name.

Example
Here, there are three font types: Tahoma, Verdana, and sans-serif. The second and third fonts are backups, in case the first one is not found.

p {
font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;
}
Best Web Safe Fonts for HTML and CSS
The following list are the best web safe fonts for HTML and CSS:

Arial (sans-serif)
Verdana (sans-serif)
Helvetica (sans-serif)
Tahoma (sans-serif)
Trebuchet MS (sans-serif)
Times New Roman (serif)
Georgia (serif)
Garamond (serif)

CSS Font Style
Font Style
The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text.

This property has three values:

normal - The text is shown normally
italic - The text is shown in italics
oblique - The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)
Example
p.normal {
  font-style: normal;
}

p.italic {
  font-style: italic;
}

p.oblique {
  font-style: oblique;
}
Font Weight
The font-weight property specifies the weight of a font:

Example
p.normal {
  font-weight: normal;
}

p.thick {
  font-weight: bold;
}
Font Variant
The font-variant property specifies whether or not a text should be displayed in a small-caps font.

In a small-caps font, all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase letters. However, the converted uppercase letters appears in a smaller font size than the original uppercase letters in the text.

Example
p.normal {
  font-variant: normal;
}

p.small {
  font-variant: small-caps;
}

CSS Font Size
Font Size
The font-size property sets the size of the text.

Being able to manage the text size is important in web design. However, you should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs.

Always use the proper HTML tags, like <h1> - <h6> for headings and <p> for paragraphs.

The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.

Absolute size:

Sets the text to a specified size
Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known
Relative size:

Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
Allows a user to change the text size in browsers
Note: If you do not specify a font size, the default size for normal text, like paragraphs, is 16px (16px=1em).

Set Font Size With Pixels
Setting the text size with pixels gives you full control over the text size:

Example
h1 {
  font-size: 40px;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 30px;
}

p {
  font-size: 14px;
}
Tip: If you use pixels, you can still use the zoom tool to resize the entire page.

Set Font Size With Em
To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), many developers use em instead of pixels.

1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.

The size can be calculated from pixels to em using this formula: pixels/16=em

Example
h1 {
  font-size: 2.5em; /* 40px/16=2.5em */
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.875em; /* 30px/16=1.875em */
}

p {
  font-size: 0.875em; /* 14px/16=0.875em */
}
In the example above, the text size in em is the same as the previous example in pixels. However, with the em size, it is possible to adjust the text size in all browsers.

Unfortunately, there is still a problem with older versions of Internet Explorer. The text becomes larger than it should when made larger, and smaller than it should when made smaller.

ADVERTISEMENT

Use a Combination of Percent and Em
The solution that works in all browsers, is to set a default font-size in percent for the <body> element:

Example
body {
  font-size: 100%;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2.5em;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.875em;
}

p {
  font-size: 0.875em;
}
Our code now works great! It shows the same text size in all browsers, and allows all browsers to zoom or resize the text!

Responsive Font Size
The text size can be set with a vw unit, which means the "viewport width".

That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:

Hello World
Resize the browser window to see how the font size scales.

Example
<h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>
Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.

CSS Google Fonts
Google Fonts
If you do not want to use any of the standard fonts in HTML, you can use Google Fonts.

Google Fonts are free to use, and have more than 1000 fonts to choose from.

How To Use Google Fonts
Just add a special style sheet link in the <head> section and then refer to the font in the CSS.

Example
Here, we want to use a font named "Sofia" from Google Fonts:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sofia">
<style>
body {
  font-family: "Sofia", sans-serif;
}
</style>
</head>
Result:

Sofia Font
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

123456790

Example
Here, we want to use a font named "Trirong" from Google Fonts:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Trirong">
<style>
body {
  font-family: "Trirong", serif;
}
</style>
</head>
Result:

Trirong Font
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

123456790

Example
Here, we want to use a font named "Audiowide" from Google Fonts:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Audiowide">
<style>
body {
  font-family: "Audiowide", sans-serif;
}
</style>
</head>
Result:

Audiowide Font
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

123456790

Note: When specifying a font in CSS, always list at minimum one fallback font (to avoid unexpected behaviors). So, also here you should add a generic font family (like serif or sans-serif) to the end of the list.

For a list of all available Google Fonts, visit our How To - Google Fonts Tutorial.

Use Multiple Google Fonts
To use multiple Google fonts, just separate the font names with a pipe character (|), like this:

Example
Request multiple fonts:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Audiowide|Sofia|Trirong">
<style>
h1.a {font-family: "Audiowide", sans-serif;}
h1.b {font-family: "Sofia", sans-serif;}
h1.c {font-family: "Trirong", serif;}
</style>
</head>
Result:

Audiowide Font
Sofia Font
Trirong Font
Note: Requesting multiple fonts may slow down your web pages! So be careful about that.

Styling Google Fonts
Of course you can style Google Fonts as you like, with CSS!

Example
Style the "Sofia" font:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sofia">
<style>
body {
  font-family: "Sofia", sans-serif;
  font-size: 30px;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 3px #ababab;
}
</style>
</head>
Result:

Sofia Font
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

123456790

Enabling Font Effects
Google have also enabled different font effects that you can use.

First add effect=effectname to the Google API, then add a special class name to the element that is going to use the special effect. The class name always starts with font-effect- and ends with the effectname.

Example
Add the fire effect to the "Sofia" font:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sofia&effect=fire">
<style>
body {
  font-family: "Sofia", sans-serif;
  font-size: 30px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 class="font-effect-fire">Sofia on Fire</h1>

</body>
Result:

Sofia on Fire
To request multiple font effects, just separate the effect names with a pipe character (|), like this:

Example
Add multiple effects to the "Sofia" font:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sofia&effect=neon|outline|emboss|shadow-multiple">
<style>
body {
  font-family: "Sofia", sans-serif;
  font-size: 30px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 class="font-effect-neon">Neon Effect</h1>
<h1 class="font-effect-outline">Outline Effect</h1>
<h1 class="font-effect-emboss">Emboss Effect</h1>
<h1 class="font-effect-shadow-multiple">Multiple Shadow Effect</h1>

</body>
Result:

Neon Effect
Outline Effect
Emboss Effect
Multiple Shadow Effect

CSS Great Font Pairings
Great font pairings are essential to great design.

Font Pairing Rules
Here are some basic rules to create great font pairings:

1. Complement
It is always safe to find font pairings that complement one another.

A great font combination should harmonize, without being too similar or too different.

2. Use Font Superfamilies
A font superfamily is a set of fonts designed to work well together. So, using different fonts within the same superfamily is safe.

For example, the Lucida superfamily contains the following fonts: Lucida Sans, Lucida Serif, Lucida Typewriter Sans, Lucida Typewriter Serif and Lucida Math.

3. Contrast is King
Two fonts that are too similar will often conflict. However, contrasts, done the right way, brings out the best in each font.

Example: Combining serif with sans serif is a well known combination.

A strong superfamily includes both serif and sans serif variations of the same font (e.g. Lucida and Lucida Sans).

4. Choose Only One Boss
One font should be the boss. This establishes a hierarchy for the fonts on your page. This can be achieved by varying the size, weight and color.

Example
No doubt "Georgia" is the boss here:

body {
  background-color: black;
  font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  color: gray;
}

h1 {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  font-size: 60px;
  color: white;
}
Below, we have shown some popular font pairings that will suit many brands and contexts.

CSS Font Property
The CSS Font Property
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the individual font properties in one property.

The font property is a shorthand property for:

font-style
font-variant
font-weight
font-size/line-height
font-family
Note: The font-size and font-family values are required. If one of the other values is missing, their default value are used.

Example
Use font to set several font properties in one declaration:

p.a {
  font: 20px Arial, sans-serif;
}

p.b {
  font: italic small-caps bold 12px/30px Georgia, serif;
}
Set the font for <h1> to "Verdana".

<style>
h1 {
  
: Verdana;
}
</style>

<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>

                                                      CSS Icons
Icons can easily be added to your HTML page, by using an icon library.

      
How To Add Icons
The simplest way to add an icon to your HTML page, is with an icon library, such as Font Awesome.

Add the name of the specified icon class to any inline HTML element (like <i> or <span>).

All the icons in the icon libraries below, are scalable vectors that can be customized with CSS (size, color, shadow, etc.)

Font Awesome Icons
To use the Font Awesome icons, go to fontawesome.com, sign in, and get a code to add in the <head> section of your HTML page:

<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/yourcode.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

Read more about how to get started with Font Awesome in our Font Awesome 5 tutorial.

Note: No downloading or installation is required!

                                                          CSS Lists

HTML Lists and CSS List Properties
In HTML, there are two main types of lists:

unordered lists (<ul>) - the list items are marked with bullets
ordered lists (<ol>) - the list items are marked with numbers or letters
The CSS list properties allow you to:

Set different list item markers for ordered lists
Set different list item markers for unordered lists
Set an image as the list item marker
Add background colors to lists and list items
Different List Item Markers
The list-style-type property specifies the type of list item marker.

The following example shows some of the available list item markers:

Example
ul.a {
  list-style-type: circle;
}

ul.b {
  list-style-type: square;
}

ol.c {
  list-style-type: upper-roman;
}

ol.d {
  list-style-type: lower-alpha;
}
Note: Some of the values are for unordered lists, and some for ordered lists.

An Image as The List Item Marker
The list-style-image property specifies an image as the list item marker:

Example
ul {
  list-style-image: url('sqpurple.gif');
}
Position The List Item Markers
The list-style-position property specifies the position of the list-item markers (bullet points).

"list-style-position: outside;" means that the bullet points will be outside the list item. The start of each line of a list item will be aligned vertically. This is default:

Coffee - A brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans...
Tea
Coca-cola
"list-style-position: inside;" means that the bullet points will be inside the list item. As it is part of the list item, it will be part of the text and push the text at the start:

Coffee - A brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans...
Tea
Coca-cola
Example
ul.a {
  list-style-position: outside;
}

ul.b {
  list-style-position: inside;
}
Remove Default Settings
The list-style-type:none property can also be used to remove the markers/bullets. Note that the list also has default margin and padding. To remove this, add margin:0 and padding:0 to <ul> or <ol>:

Example
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
List - Shorthand property
The list-style property is a shorthand property. It is used to set all the list properties in one declaration:

Example
ul {
  list-style: square inside url("sqpurple.gif");
}
When using the shorthand property, the order of the property values are:

list-style-type (if a list-style-image is specified, the value of this property will be displayed if the image for some reason cannot be displayed)
list-style-position (specifies whether the list-item markers should appear inside or outside the content flow)
list-style-image (specifies an image as the list item marker)
If one of the property values above are missing, the default value for the missing property will be inserted, if any.

Styling List With Colors
We can also style lists with colors, to make them look a little more interesting.

Anything added to the <ol> or <ul> tag, affects the entire list, while properties added to the <li> tag will affect the individual list items:

Example
ol {
  background: #ff9999;
  padding: 20px;
}

ul {
  background: #3399ff;
  padding: 20px;
}

ol li {
  background: #ffe5e5;
  color: darkred;
  padding: 5px;
  margin-left: 35px;
}

ul li {
  background: #cce5ff;
  color: darkblue;
  margin: 5px;
}
Result:

Coffee
Tea
Coca Cola
Coffee
Tea
Coca Cola

This example demonstrates all the different list-item markers in CSS.

All CSS List Properties
Property	Description
list-style	Sets all the properties for a list in one declaration
list-style-image	Specifies an image as the list-item marker
list-style-position	Specifies the position of the list-item markers (bullet points)
list-style-type	Specifies the type of list-item marker

                                                  CSS Links

With CSS, links can be styled in many different ways.

Text Link Text Link Link Button Link Button
Styling Links
Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g. color, font-family, background, etc.).

Example
a {
  color: hotpink;
}
In addition, links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.

The four links states are:

a:link - a normal, unvisited link
a:visited - a link the user has visited
a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
a:active - a link the moment it is clicked
Example
/* unvisited link */
a:link {
  color: red;
}

/* visited link */
a:visited {
  color: green;
}

/* mouse over link */
a:hover {
  color: hotpink;
}

/* selected link */
a:active {
  color: blue;
}
When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:

a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
a:active MUST come after a:hover
ADVERTISEMENT

Text Decoration
The text-decoration property is mostly used to remove underlines from links:

Example
a:link {
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:active {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
Background Color
The background-color property can be used to specify a background color for links:

Example
a:link {
  background-color: yellow;
}

a:visited {
  background-color: cyan;
}

a:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

a:active {
  background-color: hotpink;
} 
Link Buttons
This example demonstrates a more advanced example where we combine several CSS properties to display links as boxes/buttons:

Example
a:link, a:visited {
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: white;
  padding: 14px 25px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
}

a:hover, a:active {
  background-color: red;
}
More Examples
Example
This example demonstrates how to add other styles to hyperlinks:

a.one:link {color: #ff0000;}
a.one:visited {color: #0000ff;}
a.one:hover {color: #ffcc00;}

a.two:link {color: #ff0000;}
a.two:visited {color: #0000ff;}
a.two:hover {font-size: 150%;}

a.three:link {color: #ff0000;}
a.three:visited {color: #0000ff;}
a.three:hover {background: #66ff66;}

a.four:link {color: #ff0000;}
a.four:visited {color: #0000ff;}
a.four:hover {font-family: monospace;}

a.five:link {color: #ff0000; text-decoration: none;}
a.five:visited {color: #0000ff; text-decoration: none;}
a.five:hover {text-decoration: underline;}
Example
Another example of how to create link boxes/buttons:

a:link, a:visited {
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
  border: 2px solid green;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
}

a:hover, a:active {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
}
Example
This example demonstrates the different types of cursors (can be useful for links):

<span style="cursor: auto">auto</span><br>
<span style="cursor: crosshair">crosshair</span><br>
<span style="cursor: default">default</span><br>
<span style="cursor: e-resize">e-resize</span><br>

CSS Tables
The look of an HTML table can be greatly improved with CSS:

Company	Contact	Country
Alfreds Futterkiste	Maria Anders	Germany
Berglunds snabbköp	Christina Berglund	Sweden
Centro comercial Moctezuma	Francisco Chang	Mexico
Ernst Handel	Roland Mendel	Austria
Island Trading	Helen Bennett	UK
Königlich Essen	Philip Cramer	Germany
Laughing Bacchus Winecellars	Yoshi Tannamuri	Canada
Magazzini Alimentari Riuniti	Giovanni Rovelli	Italy

Table Borders
To specify table borders in CSS, use the border property.

The example below specifies a solid border for <table>, <th>, and <td> elements:

Firstname	Lastname
Peter	Griffin
Lois	Griffin
Example
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

Full-Width Table
The table above might seem small in some cases. If you need a table that should span the entire screen (full-width), add width: 100% to the <table> element:

Firstname	Lastname
Peter	Griffin
Lois	Griffin
Example
table {
  width: 100%;
}
Double Borders
Notice that the table in the examples above have double borders. This is because both the table and the <th> and <td> elements have separate borders.

To remove double borders, take a look at the example below.

Collapse Table Borders
The border-collapse property sets whether the table borders should be collapsed into a single border:

Firstname	Lastname
Peter	Griffin
Lois	Griffin
Example
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
If you only want a border around the table, only specify the border property for <table>:

Firstname	Lastname
Peter	Griffin
Lois	Griffin
Example
table {
  border: 1px solid;
}

CSS Table Size
Table Width and Height
The width and height of a table are defined by the width and height properties.

The example below sets the width of the table to 100%, and the height of the <th> elements to 70px:

Firstname	Lastname	Savings
Peter	Griffin	$100
Lois	Griffin	$150
Joe	Swanson	$300
Example
table {
  width: 100%;
}

th {
  height: 70px;
}
To create a table that should only span half the page, use width: 50%:

Firstname	Lastname	Savings
Peter	Griffin	$100
Lois	Griffin	$150
Joe	Swanson	$300
Example
table {
  width: 50%;
}

CSS Table Alignment
Horizontal Alignment
The text-align property sets the horizontal alignment (like left, right, or center) of the content in <th> or <td>.

By default, the content of <th> elements are center-aligned and the content of <td> elements are left-aligned.

To center-align the content of  <td> elements as well, use text-align: center:

Firstname	Lastname	Savings
Peter	Griffin	$100
Lois	Griffin	$150
Joe	Swanson	$300
Example
td {
  text-align: center;
}
To left-align the content, force the alignment of <th> elements to be left-aligned, with the text-align: left property:

Firstname	Lastname	Savings
Peter	Griffin	$100
Lois	Griffin	$150
Joe	Swanson	$300
Example
th {
  text-align: left;
}
Vertical Alignment
The vertical-align property sets the vertical alignment (like top, bottom, or middle) of the content in <th> or <td>.

By default, the vertical alignment of the content in a table is middle (for both <th> and <td> elements).

The following example sets the vertical text alignment to bottom for <td> elements:

Firstname	Lastname	Savings
Peter	Griffin	$100
Lois	Griffin	$150
Joe	Swanson	$300
Example
td {
  height: 50px;
  vertical-align: bottom;
}

CSS Table Style
Table Padding
To control the space between the border and the content in a table, use the padding property on <td> and <th> elements:

First Name	Last Name	Savings
Peter	Griffin	$100
Lois	Griffin	$150
Joe	Swanson	$300
Example
th, td {
  padding: 15px;
  text-align: left;
}
Horizontal Dividers
First Name	Last Name	Savings
Peter	Griffin	$100
Lois	Griffin	$150
Joe	Swanson	$300
Add the border-bottom property to <th> and <td> for horizontal dividers:

Example
th, td {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
}
Hoverable Table
Use the :hover selector on <tr> to highlight table rows on mouse over:

First Name	Last Name	Savings
Peter	Griffin	$100
Lois	Griffin	$150
Joe	Swanson	$300
Example
tr:hover {background-color: coral;}
ADVERTISEMENT

Striped Tables
First Name	Last Name	Savings
Peter	Griffin	$100
Lois	Griffin	$150
Joe	Swanson	$300
For zebra-striped tables, use the nth-child() selector and add a background-color to all even (or odd) table rows:

Example
tr:nth-child(even) {background-color: #f2f2f2;}
Table Color
The example below specifies the background color and text color of <th> elements:

First Name	Last Name	Savings
Peter	Griffin	$100
Lois	Griffin	$150
Joe	Swanson	$300
Example
th {
  background-color: #04AA6D;
  color: white;
}

CSS Responsive Table
Responsive Table
A responsive table will display a horizontal scroll bar if the screen is too small to display the full content:

First Name	Last Name	Points	Points	Points	Points	Points	Points	Points	Points	Points	Points	Points	Points
Jill	Smith	50	50	50	50	50	50	50	50	50	50	50	50
Eve	Jackson	94	94	94	94	94	94	94	94	94	94	94	94
Adam	Johnson	67	67	67	67	67	67	67	67	67	67	67	67
Add a container element (like <div>) with overflow-x:auto around the <table> element to make it responsive:

Example
<div style="overflow-x:auto;">

<table>
... table content ...
</table>

</div>
Note: In OS X Lion (on Mac), scrollbars are hidden by default and only shown when being used (even though "overflow:scroll" is set).

CSS Table Properties
Property	Description
border	Sets all the border properties in one declaration
border-collapse	Specifies whether or not table borders should be collapsed
border-spacing	Specifies the distance between the borders of adjacent cells
caption-side	Specifies the placement of a table caption
empty-cells	Specifies whether or not to display borders and background on empty cells in a table
table-layout	Sets the layout algorithm to be used for a table

                                              CSS Layout - The display Property

The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.

The display Property
The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

Click to show panel

This panel contains a <div> element, which is hidden by default (display: none).

It is styled with CSS, and we use JavaScript to show it (change it to (display: block).

Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

The <div> element is a block-level element.
Examples of block-level elements:

<div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>
Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.

Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>
Display: none;
display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.

The <script> element uses display: none; as default. 

ADVERTISEMENT

Override The Default Display Value
As mentioned, every element has a default display value. However, you can override this.

Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful for making the page look a specific way, and still follow the web standards.

A common example is making inline <li> elements for horizontal menus:

Example
li {
  display: inline;
}
Note: Setting the display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, NOT what kind of element it is. So, an inline element with display: block; is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.

The following example displays <span> elements as block elements:

Example
span {
  display: block;
}
The following example displays <a> elements as block elements:

Example
a {
  display: block;
}
Hide an Element - display:none or visibility:hidden?
display:none

Italy

visibility:hidden

Forest

Reset

Lights

Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to none. The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there:

Example
h1.hidden {
  display: none;
}
visibility:hidden; also hides an element.

However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout:

Example
h1.hidden {
  visibility: hidden;
}

                                                          CSS Layout - width and max-width

Using width, max-width and margin: auto;
As mentioned in the previous chapter; a block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container. Then, you can set the margins to auto, to horizontally center the element within its container. The element will take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins:

This <div> element has a width of 500px, and margin set to auto.

Note: The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element. The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on small devices:

This <div> element has a max-width of 500px, and margin set to auto.

Tip: Resize the browser window to less than 500px wide, to see the difference between the two divs!

Here is an example of the two divs above:

Example
div.ex1 {
  width: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

div.ex2 {
  max-width: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

                                                        CSS Layout - The position Property

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).

The position Property
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

static
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky
Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.

position: static;
HTML elements are positioned static by default.

Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:

This <div> element has position: static;
Here is the CSS that is used:

Example
div.static {                    /* do not add .static its just for explanation sake */
  position: static;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
position: relative;
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

This <div> element has position: relative;
Here is the CSS that is used:

Example
div.relative {              /* do not add .relative its just for explanation sake */
  position: relative;
  left: 30px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

position: fixed;
An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:

Example
div.fixed {           /* do not add .fixed its just for explanation sake */
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
This <div> element has position: fixed;
position: absolute;
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.

Here is a simple example:

This <div> element has position: relative;This <div> element has position: absolute;
Here is the CSS that is used:

Example
div.relative {      /* do not add .relative its just for explanation sake */
  position: relative;
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

div.absolute {            /* do not add .absolute its just for explanation sake */
  position: absolute;
  top: 80px;
  right: 0;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
position: sticky;
An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).


Note: Internet Explorer does not support sticky positioning. Safari requires a -webkit- prefix (see example below). You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.

In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll position.

Example
div.sticky {                                    /* do not add .sticky its just for explanation sake */
  position: -webkit-sticky; /* Safari */
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background-color: green;
  border: 2px solid #4CAF50;
}

                                                  CSS Layout - The z-index Property

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.

The z-index Property
When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).

An element can have a positive or negative stack order:

This is a headingBecause the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text.
Example
img {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0px;
  top: 0px;
  z-index: -1;
}
Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display: flex elements).

Another z-index Example
Example
Here we see that an element with greater stack order is always above an element with a lower stack order:

<html>
<head>
<style>
.container {
  position: relative;
}

.black-box {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
  border: 2px solid black;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 30px;
}

.gray-box {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 3;
  background: lightgray;
  height: 60px;
  width: 70%;
  left: 50px;
  top: 50px;
}

.green-box {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 2;
  background: lightgreen;
  width: 35%;
  left: 270px;
  top: -15px;
  height: 100px;
}
</style>
</head>

<div class="container">
  <div class="black-box">Black box</div>
  <div class="gray-box">Gray box</div>
  <div class="green-box">Green box</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
Without z-index
If two positioned elements overlap each other without a z-index specified, the element defined last in the HTML code will be shown on top.

Example
Same example as above, but here with no z-index specified:

<html>
<head>
<style>
.container {
  position: relative;

                                                CSS Layout - Overflow

The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.

This text is really long and the height of its container is only 100 pixels. Therefore, a scrollbar is added to help the reader to scroll the content. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.

Typi non habent claritatem insitam; est usus legentis in iis qui facit eorum claritatem.

CSS Overflow
The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary
Note: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.

Note: In OS X Lion (on Mac), scrollbars are hidden by default and only shown when being used (even though "overflow:scroll" is set).

overflow: visible
By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:

You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
Example
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 65px;
  background-color: coral;
  overflow: visible;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

overflow: hidden
With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden:

You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
Example
div {
  overflow: hidden;
}
overflow: scroll
Setting the value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):

You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
Example
div {
  overflow: scroll;
}
overflow: auto
The auto value is similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary:

You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
Example
div {

}
overflow-x and overflow-y
The overflow-x and overflow-y properties specifies whether to change the overflow of content just horizontally or vertically (or both):

overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.
overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.

You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
Example
div {
  overflow-x: hidden; /* Hide horizontal scrollbar */
  overflow-y: scroll; /* Add vertical scrollbar */
}

                                            CSS Layout - float and clear

The CSS float property specifies how an element should float.

The CSS clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.



The float Property
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

left - The element floats to the left of its container
right - The element floats to the right of its container
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.

Example - float: right;
The following example specifies that an image should float to the right in a text:

PineappleLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. Maecenas nisl est, ultrices nec congue eget, auctor vitae massa. Fusce luctus vestibulum augue ut aliquet. Mauris ante ligula, facilisis sed ornare eu, lobortis in odio. Praesent convallis urna a lacus interdum ut hendrerit risus congue. Nunc sagittis dictum nisi, sed ullamcorper ipsum dignissim ac...

Example
img {
  float: right;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

Example - float: left;
The following example specifies that an image should float to the left in a text:

PineappleLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. Maecenas nisl est, ultrices nec congue eget, auctor vitae massa. Fusce luctus vestibulum augue ut aliquet. Mauris ante ligula, facilisis sed ornare eu, lobortis in odio. Praesent convallis urna a lacus interdum ut hendrerit risus congue. Nunc sagittis dictum nisi, sed ullamcorper ipsum dignissim ac...

Example
img {
  float: left;
}
Example - No float
In the following example the image will be displayed just where it occurs in the text (float: none;):

Pineapple Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. Maecenas nisl est, ultrices nec congue eget, auctor vitae massa. Fusce luctus vestibulum augue ut aliquet. Mauris ante ligula, facilisis sed ornare eu, lobortis in odio. Praesent convallis urna a lacus interdum ut hendrerit risus congue. Nunc sagittis dictum nisi, sed ullamcorper ipsum dignissim ac...

Example
img {
  float: none;
}
Example - Float Next To Each Other
Normally div elements will be displayed on top of each other. However, if we use float: left we can let elements float next to each other:

Example
div {
  float: left;
  padding: 15px;
}

.div1 {
  background: red;
}

.div2 {
  background: yellow;
}

.div3 {
  background: green;
}

CSS Layout - clear and clearfix
The clear Property
When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.

The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.

The clear property can have one of the following values:

none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent
When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.

Example
This example clears the float to the left. Here, it means that the <div2> element is pushed below the left floated <div1> element: 

div1 {
  float: left;
}

div2 {
  clear: left;
}
The clearfix Hack
If a floated element is taller than the containing element, it will "overflow" outside of its container. We can then add a clearfix hack to solve this problem:

Without Clearfix

With Clearfix

Example
.clearfix {
  overflow: auto;
}
The overflow: auto clearfix works well as long as you are able to keep control of your margins and padding (else you might see scrollbars). The new, modern clearfix hack however, is safer to use, and the following code is used for most webpages:

Example
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}
You will learn more about the ::after pseudo-element in a later chapter.

CSS Layout - Float Examples
This page contains common float examples.

Grid of Boxes / Equal Width Boxes
Box 1

Box 2


Box 1

Box 2

Box 3

With the float property, it is easy to float boxes of content side by side:

Example
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.box {
  float: left;
  width: 33.33%; /* three boxes (use 25% for four, and 50% for two, etc) */
  padding: 50px; /* if you want space between the images */
}
What is box-sizing?

You can easily create three floating boxes side by side. However, when you add something that enlarges the width of each box (e.g. padding or borders), the box will break. The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in the box's total width (and height), making sure that the padding stays inside of the box and that it does not break.

You can read more about the box-sizing property in our CSS Box Sizing Chapter.

Images Side By Side
ItalyForestMountains
The grid of boxes can also be used to display images side by side:

Example
.img-container {
  float: left;
  width: 33.33%; /* three containers (use 25% for four, and 50% for two, etc) */
  padding: 5px; /* if you want space between the images */
}
ADVERTISEMENT

Equal Height Boxes
In the previous example, you learned how to float boxes side by side with an equal width. However, it is not easy to create floating boxes with equal heights. A quick fix however, is to set a fixed height, like in the example below:

Box 1
Some content, some content, some content

Box 2
Some content, some content, some content

Some content, some content, some content

Some content, some content, some content

Example
.box {
  height: 500px;
}
However, this is not very flexible. It is ok if you can guarantee that the boxes will always have the same amount of content in them. But many times, the content is not the same. If you try the example above on a mobile phone, you will see that the second box's content will be displayed outside of the box. This is where CSS3 Flexbox comes in handy - as it can automatically stretch boxes to be as long as the longest box:

Example
Using Flexbox to create flexible boxes:

Box 1 - This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall. This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall. This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall.
Box 2 - My height will follow Box 1.
Tip:  You can read more about the Flexbox Layout Module in our CSS Flexbox Chapter.

Navigation Menu
You can also use float with a list of hyperlinks to create a horizontal menu:

Example
HomeNewsContactAbout
Web Layout Example
It is also common to do entire web layouts using the float property:


Example
.header, .footer {
  background-color: grey;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px;
}

.column {
  float: left;
  padding: 15px;
}

.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}

.menu {
  width: 25%;
}

.content {
  width: 75%;
}

                                                CSS Layout - display: inline-block

The display: inline-block Value
Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.

Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

The following example shows the different behavior of display: inline, display: inline-block and display: block:

Example
span.a {
  display: inline; /* the default for span */
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  background-color: yellow;
}

span.b {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  background-color: yellow;
}

span.c {
  display: block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  background-color: yellow;
}
Using inline-block to Create Navigation Links
One common use for display: inline-block is to display list items horizontally instead of vertically. The following example creates horizontal navigation links:

Example
.nav {
  background-color: yellow;
  list-style-type: none;
  text-align: center; 
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}

.nav li {
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}

▲▼
◀►
Center elements
horizontally and vertically
Center Align Elements
To horizontally center a block element (like <div>), use margin: auto;

Setting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.

The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins:

This div element is centered.

Example
.center {
  margin: auto;
  width: 50%;
  border: 3px solid green;
  padding: 10px;
}
Note: Center aligning has no effect if the width property is not set (or set to 100%).

Center Align Text
To just center the text inside an element, use text-align: center;

This text is centered.

Example
.center {
  text-align: center;
  border: 3px solid green;
}
Tip: For more examples on how to align text, see the CSS Text chapter.

Center an Image
To center an image, set left and right margin to auto and make it into a block element:

Paris
Example
img {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 40%;
}
Left and Right Align - Using position
One method for aligning elements is to use position: absolute;:

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

Example
.right {
  position: absolute;
  right: 0px;
  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
  padding: 10px;
}
Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.

Left and Right Align - Using float
Another method for aligning elements is to use the float property:

Example
.right {
  float: right;
  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
  padding: 10px;
}
The clearfix Hack
Note: If an element is taller than the element containing it, and it is floated, it will overflow outside of its container. You can use the "clearfix hack" to fix this (see example below).

Without Clearfix

With Clearfix

Then we can add the clearfix hack to the containing element to fix this problem:

Example
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}
Center Vertically - Using padding
There are many ways to center an element vertically in CSS. A simple solution is to use top and bottom padding:

I am vertically centered.

Example
.center {
  padding: 70px 0;
  border: 3px solid green;
}
To center both vertically and horizontally, use padding and text-align: center:

I am vertically and horizontally centered.

Example
.center {
  padding: 70px 0;
  border: 3px solid green;
  text-align: center;
}
Center Vertically - Using line-height
Another trick is to use the line-height property with a value that is equal to the height property:

I am vertically and horizontally centered.
Example
.center {
  line-height: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 3px solid green;
  text-align: center;
}

/* If the text has multiple lines, add the following: */
.center p {
  line-height: 1.5;
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
Center Vertically - Using position & transform
If padding and line-height are not options, another solution is to use positioning and the transform property:

I am vertically and horizontally centered.
Example
.center {
  height: 200px;
  position: relative;
  border: 3px solid green;
}

.center p {
  margin: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
Tip: You will learn more about the transform property in our 2D Transforms Chapter.

Center Vertically - Using Flexbox
You can also use flexbox to center things. Just note that flexbox is not supported in IE10 and earlier versions:

I am vertically and horizontally centered.
Example
.center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 200px;
  border: 3px solid green;
}
Tip: You will learn more about Flexbox in our CSS Flexbox Chapter.

                                                                  CSS Combinators

CSS Combinators
A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.

A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

descendant selector (space)
child selector (>)
adjacent sibling selector (+)
general sibling selector (~)
Descendant Selector
The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements: 

Example
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
Child Selector (>)
The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element:

Example
div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".

The following example selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements:

Example
div + p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
General Sibling Selector (~)
The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements that are next siblings of <div> elements: 

Example
div ~ p {
  background-color: yellow;
}


All CSS Combinator Selectors
Selector	Example	Example description
element element	div p	Selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements
element>element	div > p	Selects all <p> elements where the parent is a <div> element
element+element	div + p	Selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements
element1~element2	p ~ ul	Selects every <ul> element that are preceded by a <p> element

                                                              CSS Pseudo-classes

What are Pseudo-classes?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus
Mouse Over Me

Click Me To Get Focus
Syntax
The syntax of pseudo-classes:

selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
Anchor Pseudo-classes
Links can be displayed in different ways:

Example
/* unvisited link */
a:link {
  color: #FF0000;
}

/* visited link */
a:visited {
  color: #00FF00;
}

/* mouse over link */
a:hover {
  color: #FF00FF;
}

/* selected link */
a:active {
  color: #0000FF;
}

Note: a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective! a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.

ADVERTISEMENT

Pseudo-classes and HTML Classes
Pseudo-classes can be combined with HTML classes:

When you hover over the link in the example, it will change color:

Example
a.highlight:hover {
  color: #ff0000;
}
Hover on <div>
An example of using the :hover pseudo-class on a <div> element:

Example
div:hover {
  background-color: blue;
}

Simple Tooltip Hover
Hover over a <div> element to show a <p> element (like a tooltip):

Hover over me to show the <p> element.
Example
p {
  display: none;
  background-color: yellow;
  padding: 20px;
}

div:hover p {
  display: block;
}

CSS - The :first-child Pseudo-class
The :first-child pseudo-class matches a specified element that is the first child of another element.

Match the first <p> element
In the following example, the selector matches any <p> element that is the first child of any element:

Example
p:first-child {
  color: blue;
}
Match the first <i> element in all <p> elements
In the following example, the selector matches the first <i> element in all <p> elements:

Example
p i:first-child {
  color: blue;
}
Match all <i> elements in all first child <p> elements
In the following example, the selector matches all <i> elements in <p> elements that are the first child of another element:

Example
p:first-child i {
  color: blue;
}
CSS - The :lang Pseudo-class
The :lang pseudo-class allows you to define special rules for different languages.

In the example below, :lang defines the quotation marks for <q> elements with lang="no":

Example
<html>
<head>
<style>
q:lang(no) {
  quotes: "~" "~";
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>Some text <q lang="no">A quote in a paragraph</q> Some text.</p>

</body>
</html>

What are Pseudo-Elements?
A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style the first letter, or line, of an element
Insert content before, or after, the content of an element
Syntax
The syntax of pseudo-elements:

selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
The ::first-line Pseudo-element
The ::first-line pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first line of a text.

The following example formats the first line of the text in all <p> elements:

Example 
p::first-line {
  color: #ff0000;
  font-variant: small-caps;
}
Note: The ::first-line pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements.

The following properties apply to the ::first-line pseudo-element:

font properties
color properties
background properties
word-spacing
letter-spacing
text-decoration
vertical-align
text-transform
line-height
clear
Notice the double colon notation - ::first-line versus :first-line

The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

The single-colon syntax was used for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS2 and CSS1.

For backward compatibility, the single-colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and CSS1 pseudo-elements.

The ::first-letter Pseudo-element
The ::first-letter pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first letter of a text.

The following example formats the first letter of the text in all <p> elements: 

Example
p::first-letter {
  color: #ff0000;
  font-size: xx-large;
}
Note: The ::first-letter pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements.

The following properties apply to the ::first-letter pseudo- element: 

font properties
color properties 
background properties
margin properties
padding properties
border properties
text-decoration
vertical-align (only if "float" is "none")
text-transform
line-height
float
clear
Pseudo-elements and HTML Classes
Pseudo-elements can be combined with HTML classes: 

Example
p.intro::first-letter {
  color: #ff0000;
  font-size: 200%;
}
The example above will display the first letter of paragraphs with class="intro", in red and in a larger size.

Multiple Pseudo-elements
Several pseudo-elements can also be combined.

In the following example, the first letter of a paragraph will be red, in an xx-large font size. The rest of the first line will be blue, and in small-caps. The rest of the paragraph will be the default font size and color:

Example
p::first-letter {
  color: #ff0000;
  font-size: xx-large;
}

p::first-line {
  color: #0000ff;
  font-variant: small-caps;
}
CSS - The ::before Pseudo-element
The ::before pseudo-element can be used to insert some content before the content of an element.

The following example inserts an image before the content of each <h1> element:

Example
h1::before {
  content: url(smiley.gif);
}
CSS - The ::after Pseudo-element
The ::after pseudo-element can be used to insert some content after the content of an element.

The following example inserts an image after the content of each <h1> element:

Example
h1::after {
  content: url(smiley.gif);
}
CSS - The ::marker Pseudo-element
The ::marker pseudo-element selects the markers of list items.

The following example styles the markers of list items:

Example
::marker {
  color: red;
  font-size: 23px;
}
CSS - The ::selection Pseudo-element
The ::selection pseudo-element matches the portion of an element that is selected by a user.

The following CSS properties can be applied to ::selection: color, background, cursor, and outline.

The following example makes the selected text red on a yellow background:

Example
::selection {
  color: red;
  background: yellow;
}

<p class="intro">
In my younger and more vulnerable years
my father gave me some advice that I've
been turning over in my mind ever since.
'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me,
'just remember that all the people in this world
haven't had the advantages that you've had.'

                                                              CSS Opacity / Transparency

The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element.

Transparent Image
The opacity property can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower value, the more transparent:

Forest
opacity 0.2

Forest
opacity 0.5

Forest
opacity 1
(default)

Example
img {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
Transparent Hover Effect
The opacity property is often used together with the :hover selector to change the opacity on mouse-over:

Northern LightsMountainsItaly
Example
img {
  opacity: 0.5;
}

img:hover {
  opacity: 1.0;
}
Example explained
The first CSS block is similar to the code in Example 1. In addition, we have added what should happen when a user hovers over one of the images. In this case we want the image to NOT be transparent when the user hovers over it. The CSS for this is opacity:1;.

When the mouse pointer moves away from the image, the image will be transparent again.

An example of reversed hover effect:

Northern LightsMountainsItaly
Example
img:hover {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

Transparent Box
When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, all of its child elements inherit the same transparency. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read:

opacity 1

opacity 0.6

opacity 0.3

opacity 0.1

Example
div {
  opacity: 0.3;
}
Transparency using RGBA
If you do not want to apply opacity to child elements, like in our example above, use RGBA color values. The following example sets the opacity for the background color and not the text:

100% opacity

60% opacity

30% opacity

10% opacity

You learned from our CSS Colors Chapter, that you can use RGB as a color value. In addition to RGB, you can use an RGB color value with an alpha channel (RGBA) - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha). The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).

Tip: You will learn more about RGBA Colors in our CSS Colors Chapter.

Example
div {
  background: rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.3) /* Green background with 30% opacity */
}
Text in Transparent Box
This is some text that is placed in the transparent box.

Example
<html>
<head>
<style>
div.background {
  background: url(klematis.jpg) repeat;
  border: 2px solid black;
}

div.transbox {
  margin: 30px;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  border: 1px solid black;
  opacity: 0.6;
}

div.transbox p {
  margin: 5%;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #000000;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="background">
  <div class="transbox">
    <p>This is some text that is placed in the transparent box.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
Example explained
First, we create a <div> element (class="background") with a background image, and a border.

Then we create another <div> (class="transbox") inside the first <div>.

The <div class="transbox"> have a background color, and a border - the div is transparent.

Inside the transparent <div>, we add some text inside a <p> element.

Navigation Bars
Having easy-to-use navigation is important for any web site.

With CSS you can transform boring HTML menus into good-looking navigation bars.

Navigation Bar = List of Links
A navigation bar needs standard HTML as a base.

In our examples we will build the navigation bar from a standard HTML list.

A navigation bar is basically a list of links, so using the <ul> and <li> elements makes perfect sense:

Example
<ul>
  <li><a href="default.asp">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="news.asp">News</a></li>
  <li><a href="contact.asp">Contact</a></li>
  <li><a href="about.asp">About</a></li>
</ul>
Now let's remove the bullets and the margins and padding from the list:

Example
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
Example explained:

list-style-type: none; - Removes the bullets. A navigation bar does not need list markers
Set margin: 0; and padding: 0; to remove browser default settings
The code in the example above is the standard code used in both vertical, and horizontal navigation bars, which you will learn more about in the next chapters.

CSS Vertical Navigation Bar
Vertical Navigation Bar
Home
News
Contact
About
To build a vertical navigation bar, you can style the <a> elements inside the list, in addition to the code from the previous page:

Example
li a {
  display: block;
  width: 60px;
}
Example explained:

display: block; - Displaying the links as block elements makes the whole link area clickable (not just the text), and it allows us to specify the width (and padding, margin, height, etc. if you want)
width: 60px; - Block elements take up the full width available by default. We want to specify a 60 pixels width
You can also set the width of <ul>, and remove the width of <a>, as they will take up the full width available when displayed as block elements. This will produce the same result as our previous example:

Example
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  width: 60px;
}

li a {
  display: block;
}

Vertical Navigation Bar Examples
Create a basic vertical navigation bar with a gray background color and change the background color of the links when the user moves the mouse over them:

Home
News
Contact
About
Example
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  width: 200px;
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
}

li a {
  display: block;
  color: #000;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* Change the link color on hover */
li a:hover {
  background-color: #555;
  color: white;
}
Active/Current Navigation Link
Add an "active" class to the current link to let the user know which page he/she is on:

Home
News
Contact
About
Example
.active {
  background-color: #04AA6D;
  color: white;
}
Center Links & Add Borders
Add text-align:center to <li> or <a> to center the links.

Add the border property to <ul> add a border around the navbar. If you also want borders inside the navbar, add a border-bottom to all <li> elements, except for the last one:

Home
News
Contact
About
Example
ul {
  border: 1px solid #555;
}

li {
  text-align: center;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #555;
}

li:last-child {
  border-bottom: none;
}
Full-height Fixed Vertical Navbar
Create a full-height, "sticky" side navigation:


Example
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  width: 25%;
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
  height: 100%; /* Full height */
  position: fixed; /* Make it stick, even on scroll */
  overflow: auto; /* Enable scrolling if the sidenav has too much content */
}
Note: This example might not work properly on mobile devices.

CSS Horizontal Navigation Bar
Horizontal Navigation Bar
HomeNewsContactAbout
There are two ways to create a horizontal navigation bar. Using inline or floating list items.

Inline List Items
One way to build a horizontal navigation bar is to specify the <li> elements as inline, in addition to the "standard" code from the previous page:

Example
li {
  display: inline;
}
Example explained:

display: inline; - By default, <li> elements are block elements. Here, we remove the line breaks before and after each list item, to display them on one line
Floating List Items
Another way of creating a horizontal navigation bar is to float the <li> elements, and specify a layout for the navigation links:

Example
li {
  float: left;
}

a {
  display: block;
  padding: 8px;
  background-color: #dddddd;
}
Example explained:

float: left; - Use float to get block elements to float next to each other
display: block; - Allows us to specify padding (and height, width, margins, etc. if you want)
padding: 8px; - Specify some padding between each <a> element, to make them look good
background-color: #dddddd; - Add a gray background-color to each <a> element
Tip: Add the background-color to <ul> instead of each <a> element if you want a full-width background color:

Example
ul {
  background-color: #dddddd;
}
Horizontal Navigation Bar Examples
Create a basic horizontal navigation bar with a dark background color and change the background color of the links when the user moves the mouse over them:

HomeNewsContactAbout
Example
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #333;
}

li {
  float: left;
}

li a {
  display: block;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 14px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* Change the link color to #111 (black) on hover */
li a:hover {
  background-color: #111;
}
Active/Current Navigation Link
Add an "active" class to the current link to let the user know which page he/she is on:

HomeNewsContactAbout
Example
.active {
  background-color: #04AA6D;
}
Right-Align Links
Right-align links by floating the list items to the right (float:right;):

HomeNewsContactAbout
Example
<ul>
  <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="#news">News</a></li>
  <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  <li style="float:right"><a class="active" href="#about">About</a></li>
</ul>
Border Dividers
Add the border-right property to <li> to create link dividers:

HomeNewsContactAbout
Example
/* Add a gray right border to all list items, except the last item (last-child) */
li {
  border-right: 1px solid #bbb;
}

li:last-child {
  border-right: none;
}
Fixed Navigation Bar
Make the navigation bar stay at the top or the bottom of the page, even when the user scrolls the page:

Fixed Top
ul {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
}

Fixed Bottom
ul {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
Note: Fixed position might not work properly on mobile devices.

Gray Horizontal Navbar
An example of a gray horizontal navigation bar with a thin gray border:

HomeNewsContactAbout
Example
ul {
  border: 1px solid #e7e7e7;
  background-color: #f3f3f3;
}

li a {
  color: #666;
}
Sticky Navbar
Add position: sticky; to <ul> to create a sticky navbar.

A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).


Example
ul {
  position: -webkit-sticky; /* Safari */
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
Note: Internet Explorer do not support sticky positioning. Safari requires a -webkit- prefix (see example above). You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.

                                                  CSS Dropdowns

Create a hoverable dropdown with CSS.

Demo: Dropdown Examples
Move the mouse over the examples below:

Dropdown TextDropdown MenuOther: Cinque Terre
Basic Dropdown
Create a dropdown box that appears when the user moves the mouse over an element.

Example
<style>
.dropdown {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
}

.dropdown-content {
  display: none;
  position: absolute;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  min-width: 160px;
  box-shadow: 0px 8px 16px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  padding: 12px 16px;
  z-index: 1;
}

.dropdown:hover .dropdown-content {
  display: block;
}
</style>

<div class="dropdown">
  <span>Mouse over me</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
    <p>Hello World!</p>
  </div>
</div>
Example Explained
HTML) Use any element to open the dropdown content, e.g. a <span>, or a <button> element.

Use a container element (like <div>) to create the dropdown content and add whatever you want inside of it.

Wrap a <div> element around the elements to position the dropdown content correctly with CSS.

CSS) The .dropdown class uses position:relative, which is needed when we want the dropdown content to be placed right below the dropdown button (using position:absolute).

The .dropdown-content class holds the actual dropdown content. It is hidden by default, and will be displayed on hover (see below). Note the min-width is set to 160px. Feel free to change this. Tip: If you want the width of the dropdown content to be as wide as the dropdown button, set the width to 100% (and overflow:auto to enable scroll on small screens).

Instead of using a border, we have used the CSS box-shadow property to make the dropdown menu look like a "card".

The :hover selector is used to show the dropdown menu when the user moves the mouse over the dropdown button.

Dropdown Menu
Create a dropdown menu that allows the user to choose an option from a list:

Dropdown Menu
This example is similar to the previous one, except that we add links inside the dropdown box and style them to fit a styled dropdown button:

Example
<style>
/* Style The Dropdown Button */
.dropbtn {
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
  padding: 16px;
  font-size: 16px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

/* The container <div> - needed to position the dropdown content */
.dropdown {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
}

/* Dropdown Content (Hidden by Default) */
.dropdown-content {
  display: none;
  position: absolute;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  min-width: 160px;
  box-shadow: 0px 8px 16px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  z-index: 1;
}

/* Links inside the dropdown */
.dropdown-content a {
  color: black;
  padding: 12px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: block;
}

/* Change color of dropdown links on hover */
.dropdown-content a:hover {background-color: #f1f1f1}

/* Show the dropdown menu on hover */
.dropdown:hover .dropdown-content {
  display: block;
}

/* Change the background color of the dropdown button when the dropdown content is shown */
.dropdown:hover .dropbtn {
  background-color: #3e8e41;
}
</style>

<div class="dropdown">
  <button class="dropbtn">Dropdown</button>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
    <a href="#">Link 1</a>
    <a href="#">Link 2</a>
    <a href="#">Link 3</a>
  </div>
</div>
Right-aligned Dropdown Content
LeftRight
If you want the dropdown menu to go from right to left, instead of left to right, add right: 0;

Example
.dropdown-content {
  right: 0;
}

                                                    CSS Image Sprites

Image Sprites
An image sprite is a collection of images put into a single image.

A web page with many images can take a long time to load and generates multiple server requests.

Using image sprites will reduce the number of server requests and save bandwidth.

Image Sprites - Simple Example
Instead of using three separate images, we use this single image ("img_navsprites.gif"):

navigation images

With CSS, we can show just the part of the image we need.

In the following example the CSS specifies which part of the "img_navsprites.gif" image to show:

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#home {
  width: 46px;
  height: 44px;
  background: url(img_navsprites.gif) 0 0;
}

#next {
  width: 43px;
  height: 44px;
  background: url(img_navsprites.gif) -91px 0;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<img id="home" src="img_trans.gif" width="1" height="1">
<img id="next" src="img_trans.gif" width="1" height="1">

</body>
</html>

Example explained:

<img id="home" src="img_trans.gif"> - Only defines a small transparent image because the src attribute cannot be empty. The displayed image will be the background image we specify in CSS
width: 46px; height: 44px; - Defines the portion of the image we want to use
background: url(img_navsprites.gif) 0 0; - Defines the background image and its position (left 0px, top 0px)
This is the easiest way to use image sprites, now we want to expand it by using links and hover effects.

Image Sprites - Create a Navigation List
We want to use the sprite image ("img_navsprites.gif") to create a navigation list.

We will use an HTML list, because it can be a link and also supports a background image:

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#navlist {
  position: relative;
}

#navlist li {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
}

#navlist li, #navlist a {
  height: 44px;
  display: block;
}

#home {
  left: 0px;
  width: 46px;
  background: url('img_navsprites.gif') 0 0;
}

#prev {
  left: 63px;
  width: 43px;
  background: url('img_navsprites.gif') -47px 0;
}

#next {
  left: 129px;
  width: 43px;
  background: url('img_navsprites.gif') -91px 0;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<ul id="navlist">
  <li id="home"><a href="default.asp"></a></li>
  <li id="prev"><a href="css_intro.asp"></a></li>
  <li id="next"><a href="css_syntax.asp"></a></li>
</ul>

</body>
</html>

Example explained:

#navlist {position:relative;} - position is set to relative to allow absolute positioning inside it
#navlist li {margin:0;padding:0;list-style:none;position:absolute;top:0;} - margin and padding are set to 0, list-style is removed, and all list items are absolute positioned
#navlist li, #navlist a {height:44px;display:block;} - the height of all the images are 44px
Now start to position and style for each specific part:

#home {left:0px;width:46px;} - Positioned all the way to the left, and the width of the image is 46px
#home {background:url(img_navsprites.gif) 0 0;} - Defines the background image and its position (left 0px, top 0px)
#prev {left:63px;width:43px;} - Positioned 63px to the right (#home width 46px + some extra space between items), and the width is 43px.
#prev {background:url('img_navsprites.gif') -47px 0;} - Defines the background image 47px to the right (#home width 46px + 1px line divider)
#next {left:129px;width:43px;}- Positioned 129px to the right (start of #prev is 63px + #prev width 43px + extra space), and the width is 43px.
#next {background:url('img_navsprites.gif') -91px 0;} - Defines the background image 91px to the right (#home width 46px + 1px line divider + #prev width 43px + 1px line divider )

Image Sprites - Hover Effect
Now we want to add a hover effect to our navigation list.

Tip: The :hover selector can be used on all elements, not only on links.

Our new image ("img_navsprites_hover.gif") contains three navigation images and three images to use for hover effects:

navigation images

Because this is one single image, and not six separate files, there will be no loading delay when a user hovers over the image.

We only add three lines of code to add the hover effect:

Example
#home a:hover {
  background: url('img_navsprites_hover.gif') 0 -45px;
}

#prev a:hover {
  background: url('img_navsprites_hover.gif') -47px -45px;
}

#next a:hover {
  background: url('img_navsprites_hover.gif') -91px -45px;
}
Example explained:

#home a:hover {background: url('img_navsprites_hover.gif') 0 -45px;} - For all three hover images we specify the same background position, only 45px further down

                                      CSS Attribute Selectors

Style HTML Elements With Specific Attributes
It is possible to style HTML elements that have specific attributes or attribute values.

CSS [attribute] Selector
The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.

The following example selects all <a> elements with a target attribute:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
a[target] {
  background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>CSS [attribute] Selector</h2>
<p>The links with a target attribute gets a yellow background:</p>

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a>
<a href="http://www.disney.com" target="_blank">disney.com</a>
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_top">wikipedia.org</a>

</body>
</html>

CSS [attribute="value"] Selector
The [attribute="value"] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute and value.

The following example selects all <a> elements with a target="_blank" attribute:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
a[target=_blank] {
  background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>CSS [attribute="value"] Selector</h2>
<p>The link with target="_blank" gets a yellow background:</p>

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a>
<a href="http://www.disney.com" target="_blank">disney.com</a>
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_top">wikipedia.org</a>

</body>
</html>

CSS [attribute~="value"] Selector
The [attribute~="value"] selector is used to select elements with an attribute value containing a specified word.

The following example selects all elements with a title attribute that contains a space-separated list of words, one of which is "flower":

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
[title~=flower] {
  border: 5px solid yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>CSS [attribute~="value"] Selector</h2>
<p>All images with the title attribute containing the word "flower" get a yellow border.</p>

<img src="klematis.jpg" title="klematis flower" width="150" height="113">
<img src="img_flwr.gif" title="flower" width="224" height="162">
<img src="img_tree.gif" title="tree" width="200" height="358">

</body>
</html>


The example above will match elements with title="flower", title="summer flower", and title="flower new", but not title="my-flower" or title="flowers".

CSS [attribute|="value"] Selector
The [attribute|="value"] selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute, whose value can be exactly the specified value, or the specified value followed by a hyphen (-).

Note: The value has to be a whole word, either alone, like class="top", or followed by a hyphen( - ), like class="top-text".

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
[class|=top] {
  background: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>CSS [attribute|="value"] Selector</h2>

<h1 class="top-header">Welcome</h1>
<p class="top-text">Hello world!</p>
<p class="topcontent">Are you learning CSS?</p>

</body>
</html>

CSS [attribute^="value"] Selector
The [attribute^="value"] selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute, whose value starts with the specified value.

The following example selects all elements with a class attribute value that starts with "top":

Note: The value does not have to be a whole word!

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
[class^="top"] {
  background: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>CSS [attribute^="value"] Selector</h2>

<h1 class="top-header">Welcome</h1>
<p class="top-text">Hello world!</p>
<p class="topcontent">Are you learning CSS?</p>

</body>
</html>


CSS [attribute$="value"] Selector
The [attribute$="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value ends with a specified value.

The following example selects all elements with a class attribute value that ends with "test":

Note: The value does not have to be a whole word!  

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style> 
[class$="test"] {
  background: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>CSS [attribute$="value"] Selector</h2>

<div class="first_test">The first div element.</div>
<div class="second">The second div element.</div>
<div class="my-test">The third div element.</div>
<p class="mytest">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


CSS [attribute*="value"] Selector
The [attribute*="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value contains a specified value.

The following example selects all elements with a class attribute value that contains "te":

Note: The value does not have to be a whole word!  

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style> 
[class*="te"] {
  background: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>CSS [attribute*="value"] Selector</h2>

<div class="first_test">The first div element.</div>
<div class="second">The second div element.</div>
<div class="my-test">The third div element.</div>
<p class="mytest">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Styling Forms
The attribute selectors can be useful for styling forms without class or ID:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
input[type=text] {
  width: 150px;
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  background-color: yellow;
}

input[type=button] {
  width: 120px;
  margin-left: 35px;
  display: block;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Styling Forms</h2>

<form name="input" action="" method="get">
  Firstname:<input type="text" name="Name" value="Peter" size="20">
  Lastname:<input type="text" name="Name" value="Griffin" size="20">
  <input type="button" value="Example Button">
</form>

</body>
</html>

                                                      CSS Forms

The look of an HTML form can be greatly improved with CSS:

First Name 
Your name..
 Last Name 
Your last name..
 Country 
USA
 
Styling Input Fields
Use the width property to determine the width of the input field:

First Name 
Example
input {
  width: 100%;
}
The example above applies to all <input> elements. If you only want to style a specific input type, you can use attribute selectors:

input[type=text] - will only select text fields
input[type=password] - will only select password fields
input[type=number] - will only select number fields
etc..

Padded Inputs
Use the padding property to add space inside the text field.

Tip: When you have many inputs after each other, you might also want to add some margin, to add more space outside of them:

First Name 
 Last Name 
Example
input[type=text] {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 12px 20px;
  margin: 8px 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
Note that we have set the box-sizing property to border-box. This makes sure that the padding and eventually borders are included in the total width and height of the elements.
Read more about the box-sizing property in our CSS Box Sizing chapter.

Bordered Inputs
Use the border property to change the border size and color, and use the border-radius property to add rounded corners:

First Name 
Example
input[type=text] {
  border: 2px solid red;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
If you only want a bottom border, use the border-bottom property:

First Name 
Example
input[type=text] {
  border: none;
  border-bottom: 2px solid red;
}
Colored Inputs
Use the background-color property to add a background color to the input, and the color property to change the text color:

John
Example
input[type=text] {
  background-color: #3CBC8D;
  color: white;
}
Focused Inputs
By default, some browsers will add a blue outline around the input when it gets focus (clicked on). You can remove this behavior by adding outline: none; to the input.

Use the :focus selector to do something with the input field when it gets focus:

Example
input[type=text]:focus {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
Example
input[type=text]:focus {
  border: 3px solid #555;
}
Input with icon/image
If you want an icon inside the input, use the background-image property and position it with the background-position property. Also notice that we add a large left padding to reserve the space of the icon:

Search..
Example
input[type=text] {
  background-color: white;
  background-image: url('searchicon.png');
  background-position: 10px 10px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  padding-left: 40px;
}
Animated Search Input
In this example we use the CSS transition property to animate the width of the search input when it gets focus. You will learn more about the transition property later, in our CSS Transitions chapter.

Search..
Example
input[type=text] {
  transition: width 0.4s ease-in-out;
}

input[type=text]:focus {
  width: 100%;
}
Styling Textareas
Tip: Use the resize property to prevent textareas from being resized (disable the "grabber" in the bottom right corner):

Some text...

Example
textarea {
  width: 100%;
  height: 150px;
  padding: 12px 20px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 2px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: #f8f8f8;
  resize: none;
}
Styling Select Menus

Australia
Example
select {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 16px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
}
Styling Input Buttons
 
Example
input[type=button], input[type=submit], input[type=reset] {
  background-color: #04AA6D;
  border: none;
  color: white;
  padding: 16px 32px;
  text-decoration: none;
  margin: 4px 2px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

/* Tip: use width: 100% for full-width buttons */

                                        CSS Counters

Pizza
Hamburger
Hotdogs
CSS counters are "variables" maintained by CSS whose values can be incremented by CSS rules (to track how many times they are used). Counters let you adjust the appearance of content based on its placement in the document.

Automatic Numbering With Counters
CSS counters are like "variables". The variable values can be incremented by CSS rules (which will track how many times they are used).

To work with CSS counters we will use the following properties:

counter-reset - Creates or resets a counter
counter-increment - Increments a counter value
content - Inserts generated content
counter() or counters() function - Adds the value of a counter to an element
To use a CSS counter, it must first be created with counter-reset.

The following example creates a counter for the page (in the body selector), then increments the counter value for each <h2> element and adds "Section <value of the counter>:" to the beginning of each <h2> element:

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
  counter-reset: section;
}

h2::before {
  counter-increment: section;
  content: "Section " counter(section) ": ";
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

Nesting Counters
The following example creates one counter for the page (section) and one counter for each <h1> element (subsection). The "section" counter will be counted for each <h1> element with "Section <value of the section counter>.", and the "subsection" counter will be counted for each <h2> element with "<value of the section counter>.<value of the subsection counter>":

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
  counter-reset: section;
}

h1 {
  counter-reset: subsection;
}

h1::before {
  counter-increment: section;
  content: "Section " counter(section) ". ";
}

h2::before {
  counter-increment: subsection;
  content: counter(section) "." counter(subsection) " ";
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

A counter can also be useful to make outlined lists because a new instance of a counter is automatically created in child elements. Here we use the counters() function to insert a string between different levels of nested counters:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
ol {
  counter-reset: section;
  list-style-type: none;
}

li::before {
  counter-increment: section;
  content: counters(section,".") " ";
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

                                                          CSS Website Layout

Website Layout
A website is often divided into headers, menus, content and a footer:

HeaderNavigation Menu
ContentMain ContentContentFooter
There are tons of different layout designs to choose from. However, the structure above, is one of the most common, and we will take a closer look at it in this tutorial.

Header
A header is usually located at the top of the website (or right below a top navigation menu). It often contains a logo or the website name:

Example
.header {
  background-color: #F1F1F1;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
}
Result

Header
ADVERTISEMENT

Navigation Bar
A navigation bar contains a list of links to help visitors navigating through your website:

Example
/* The navbar container */
.topnav {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #333;
}

/* Navbar links */
.topnav a {
  float: left;
  display: block;
  color: #f2f2f2;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 14px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* Links - change color on hover */
.topnav a:hover {
  background-color: #ddd;
  color: black;
}
Result

Content
The layout in this section, often depends on the target users. The most common layout is one (or combining them) of the following:

1-column (often used for mobile browsers)
2-column (often used for tablets and laptops)
3-column layout (only used for desktops)
1-column:

2-column:

3-column:

We will create a 3-column layout, and change it to a 1-column layout on smaller screens:

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>CSS Website Layout</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<style>
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
}

/* Style the header */
.header {
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Style the top navigation bar */
.topnav {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #333;
}

/* Style the topnav links */
.topnav a {
  float: left;
  display: block;
  color: #f2f2f2;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 14px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* Change color on hover */
.topnav a:hover {
  background-color: #ddd;
  color: black;
}

/* Create three equal columns that floats next to each other */
.column {
  float: left;
  width: 33.33%;
  padding: 15px;
}

/* Clear floats after the columns */
.row:after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}

/* Responsive layout - makes the three columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */
@media screen and (max-width:600px) {
  .column {
    width: 100%;
  }
}

Tip: To create a 2-column layout, change the width to 50%. To create a 4-column layout, use 25%, etc.

Tip: Do you wonder how the @media rule works? Read more about it in our CSS Media Queries chapter.

Tip: A more modern way of creating column layouts, is to use CSS Flexbox. However, it is not supported in Internet Explorer 10 and earlier versions. If you require IE6-10 support, use floats (as shown above).

To learn more about the Flexible Box Layout Module, read our CSS Flexbox chapter.

Unequal Columns
The main content is the biggest and the most important part of your site.

It is common with unequal column widths, so that most of the space is reserved for the main content. The side content (if any) is often used as an alternative navigation or to specify information relevant to the main content. Change the widths as you like, only remember that it should add up to 100% in total:

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>CSS Website Layout</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<style>

  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
}

/* Style the header */

  text-align: center;
}

/* Style the top navigation bar */

  float: left;
  display: block;
  color: #f2f2f2;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 14px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* Change color on hover */
.topnav a:hover {
  background-color: #ddd;
  color: black;
}

/* Create three unequal columns that floats next to each other */
.column {
  float: left;
  padding: 10px;
}

/* Left and right column */
.column.side {
  width: 25%;
}

/* Middle column */
.column.middle {
  width: 50%;
}

/* Clear floats after the columns */
.row:after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}

/* Responsive layout - makes the three columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */

                                                  CSS Units

CSS Units
CSS has several different units for expressing a length.

Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.

Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.

Example
Set different length values, using px (pixels):

h1 {
  font-size: 60px;
}

p {
  font-size: 25px;
  line-height: 50px;
}

Note: A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted.

For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.

There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

Absolute Lengths
The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

Unit	Description
cm	centimeters
mm	millimeters
in	inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
px *	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
pt	points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
pc	picas (1pc = 12 pt)
* Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.

Relative Lengths
Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scales better between different rendering mediums.

Unit	Description	
em	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
ex	Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
ch	Relative to width of the "0" (zero)	
rem	Relative to font-size of the root element	
vw	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
vh	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
vmin	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
vmax	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
%	Relative to the parent element	
Tip: The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!
* Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.

ADVERTISEMENT

Browser Support
The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the length unit.

Length Unit					
em, ex, %, px, cm, mm, in, pt, pc	1.0	3.0	1.0	1.0	3.5
ch	27.0	9.0	1.0	7.0	20.0
rem	4.0	9.0	3.6	4.1	11.6
vh, vw	20.0	9.0	19.0	6.0	20.0
vmin	20.0	12.0	19.0	6.0	20.0
vmax	26.0	16.0	19.0	7.0	20.0

                                                            CSS Specificity

What is Specificity?
If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.

Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declaration are ultimately applied to an element.

Look at the following examples:

Example 1
In this example, we have used the "p" element as selector, and specified a red color for this element. The text will be red:

<html>
<head>
  <style>
    p {color: red;}
  </style>
</head>
<body>

<p>Hello World!</p>

</body>
</html>

Now, look at example 2:

Example 2
In this example, we have added a class selector (named "test"), and specified a green color for this class. The text will now be green (even though we have specified a red color for the element selector "p". This is because the class selector is given higher priority:

<html>
<head>
  <style>
    .test {color: green;}
    p {color: red;}
  </style>
</head>
<body>

<p class="test">Hello World!</p>

</body>
</html>

Now, look at example 3:

Example 3
In this example, we have added the id selector (named "demo"). The text will now be blue, because the id selector is given higher priority:

<html>
<head>
  <style>
    #demo {color: blue;}
    .test {color: green;}
    p {color: red;}
  </style>
</head>
<body>

<p id="demo" class="test">Hello World!</p>

</body>
</html>

Now, look at example 4:

Example 4
In this example, we have added an inline style for the "p" element. The text will now be pink, because the inline style is given the highest priority:

<html>
<head>
  <style>
    #demo {color: blue;}
    .test {color: green;}
    p {color: red;}
  </style>
</head>
<body>

<p id="demo" class="test" style="color: pink;">Hello World!</p>

</body>
</html>

Specificity Hierarchy
Every CSS selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.

There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

Inline styles - Example: <h1 style="color: pink;">
IDs - Example: #navbar
Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]
Elements and pseudo-elements - Example: h1, :before
How to Calculate Specificity?
Memorize how to calculate specificity!

Start at 0, add 100 for each ID value, add 10 for each class value (or pseudo-class or attribute selector), add 1 for each element selector or pseudo-element.

Note: Inline style gets a specificity value of 1000, and is always given the highest priority!

Note 2: There is one exception to this rule: if you use the !important rule, it will even override inline styles!

The table below shows some examples on how to calculate specificity values:

Selector	    Specificity Value	      Calculation
p	                1                	    1
p.test          	11                	1 + 10
p#demo          	101	                1 + 100
<p style="color: pink;">	1000        	1000
#demo           	100	                  100
.test           	10                   	10
p.test1.test2	    21              	1 + 10 + 10
#navbar p#demo  	201               	100 + 1 + 100
*	0	0 (the universal selector is ignored)
The selector with the highest specificity value will win and take effect!

Consider these three code fragments:

Example
A: h1
B: h1#content
C: <h1 id="content" style="color: pink;">Heading</h1>
The specificity of A is 1 (one element selector)
The specificity of B is 101 (one ID reference + one element selector)
The specificity of C is 1000 (inline styling)

Since the third rule (C) has the highest specificity value (1000), this style declaration will be applied.

More Specificity Rules Examples
Equal specificity: the latest rule wins - If the same rule is written twice into the external style sheet, then the latest rule wins:

Example
h1 {background-color: yellow;}
h1 {background-color: red;}

ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors - Look at the following three code lines:

Example
div#a {background-color: green;}
#a {background-color: yellow;}
div[id=a] {background-color: blue;}

the first rule is more specific than the other two, and will therefore be applied.

Contextual selectors are more specific than a single element selector - The embedded style sheet is closer to the element to be styled. So in the following situation

Example
From external CSS file:
#content h1 {background-color: red;}

In HTML file:
<style>
#content h1 {background-color: yellow;}
</style>
the latter rule will be applied.

A class selector beats any number of element selectors - a class selector such as .intro beats h1, p, div, etc:

Example
.intro {background-color: yellow;}
h1 {background-color: red;}

The universal selector (*) and inherited values have a specificity of 0 - The universal selector (*) and inherited values are ignored!

                                                            CSS The !important Rule

What is !important?
The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.

In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!

Let us look at an example:

Example
#myid {
  background-color: blue;
}

.myclass {
  background-color: gray;
}

p {
  background-color: red !important;
}

Example Explained
In the example above. all three paragraphs will get a red background color, even though the ID selector and the class selector has a higher specificity. The !important rule overrides the background-color property in both cases.

Important About !important
The only way to override an !important rule is to include another !important rule on a declaration with the same (or higher) specificity in the source code - and here the problem starts! This makes the CSS code confusing and the debugging will be hard, especially if you have a large style sheet!

Here we have created a simple example. It is not very clear, when you look at the CSS source code, which color is considered most important:

Example
#myid {
  background-color: blue !important;
}

                                                CSS Math Functions

The CSS math functions allow mathematical expressions to be used as property values. Here, we will explain the calc(), max() and min() functions.

The calc() Function
The calc() function performs a calculation to be used as the property value.

CSS Syntax
calc(expression)
Value	Description
expression	Required. A mathematical expression. The result will be used as the value.
The following operators can be used: + - * /
Let us look at an example:

Example
Use calc() to calculate the width of a <div> element:

#div1 {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50px;
  width: calc(100% - 100px);
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: yellow;
  padding: 5px;
}

The max() Function
The max() function uses the largest value, from a comma-separated list of values, as the property value.

CSS Syntax
max(value1, value2, ...)
Value	Description
value1, value2, ...	Required. A list of comma-separated values - where the largest value is chosen
Let us look at an example:

Example
Use max() to set the width of #div1 to whichever value is largest, 50% or 300px:

#div1 {
  background-color: yellow;
  height: 100px;
  width: max(50%, 300px);
}

ADVERTISEMENT

The min() Function
The min() function uses the smallest value, from a comma-separated list of values, as the property value.

CSS Syntax
min(value1, value2, ...)
Value	Description
value1, value2, ...	Required. A list of comma-separated values - where the smallest value is chosen
Let us look at an example:

Example
Use min() to set the width of #div1 to whichever value is smallest, 50% or 300px:

#div1 {
  background-color: yellow;
  height: 100px;
  width: min(50%, 300px);
}

All CSS Math Functions
Function	Description
calc()	Allows you to perform calculations to determine CSS property values
max()	Uses the largest value, from a comma-separated list of values, as the property value
min()	Uses the smallest value, from a comma-separated list of values, as the property value

.myclass {
  background-color: gray !important;
}

p {
  background-color: red !important;
}

Tip: It is good to know about the !important rule, you might see it in some CSS source code. However, do not use it unless you absolutely have to.

Maybe One or Two Fair Uses of !important
One way to use !important is if you have to override a style that cannot be overridden in any other way. This could be if you are working on a Content Management System (CMS) and cannot edit the CSS code. Then you can set some custom styles to override some of the CMS styles.

Another way to use !important is: Assume you want a special look for all buttons on a page. Here, buttons are styled with a gray background color, white text, and some padding and border:

Example
.button {
  background-color: #8c8c8c;
  color: white;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

The look of a button can sometimes change if we put it inside another element with higher specificity, and the properties get in conflict. Here is an example of this:

Example
.button {
  background-color: #8c8c8c;
  color: white;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

#myDiv a {
  color: red;
  background-color: yellow;
}

To "force" all buttons to have the same look, no matter what, we can add the !important rule to the properties of the button, like this:

Example
.button {
  background-color: #8c8c8c !important;
  color: white !important;
  padding: 5px !important;
  border: 1px solid black !important;
}

#myDiv a {
  color: red;
  background-color: yellow;
}

                                                  CSS Rounded Corners

CSS Rounded Corners
With the CSS border-radius property, you can give any element "rounded corners".

CSS border-radius Property
The CSS border-radius property defines the radius of an element's corners.

Tip: This property allows you to add rounded corners to elements!

Here are three examples:

1. Rounded corners for an element with a specified background color:

Rounded corners!

2. Rounded corners for an element with a border:

Rounded corners!

3. Rounded corners for an element with a background image:

Rounded corners!

Here is the code:

Example
#rcorners1 {
  border-radius: 25px;
  background: #73AD21;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}

#rcorners2 {
  border-radius: 25px;
  border: 2px solid #73AD21;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}

#rcorners3 {
  border-radius: 25px;
  background: url(paper.gif);
  background-position: left top;
  background-repeat: repeat;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}
Tip: The border-radius property is actually a shorthand property for the border-top-left-radius, border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-right-radius and border-bottom-left-radius properties.

CSS border-radius - Specify Each Corner
The border-radius property can have from one to four values. Here are the rules:

Four values - border-radius: 15px 50px 30px 5px; (first value applies to top-left corner, second value applies to top-right corner, third value applies to bottom-right corner, and fourth value applies to bottom-left corner): 

Three values - border-radius: 15px 50px 30px; (first value applies to top-left corner, second value applies to top-right and bottom-left corners, and third value applies to bottom-right corner):

Two values - border-radius: 15px 50px; (first value applies to top-left and bottom-right corners, and the second value applies to top-right and bottom-left corners):

One value - border-radius: 15px; (the value applies to all four corners, which are rounded equally:

Here is the code:

Example
#rcorners1 {
  border-radius: 15px 50px 30px 5px;
  background: #73AD21;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}

#rcorners2 {
  border-radius: 15px 50px 30px;
  background: #73AD21;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}

#rcorners3 {
  border-radius: 15px 50px;
  background: #73AD21;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}

#rcorners4 {
  border-radius: 15px;
  background: #73AD21;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}
You could also create elliptical corners:

Example
#rcorners1 {
  border-radius: 50px / 15px;
  background: #73AD21;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}

#rcorners2 {
  border-radius: 15px / 50px;
  background: #73AD21;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}

#rcorners3 {
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: #73AD21;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
}

                                              CSS Border Images
                                              
CSS Border Images
With the CSS border-image property, you can set an image to be used as the border around an element.

CSS border-image Property
The CSS border-image property allows you to specify an image to be used instead of the normal border around an element.

The property has three parts:

The image to use as the border
Where to slice the image
Define whether the middle sections should be repeated or stretched
We will use the following image (called "border.png"):

Border

The border-image property takes the image and slices it into nine sections, like a tic-tac-toe board. It then places the corners at the corners, and the middle sections are repeated or stretched as you specify.

Note: For border-image to work, the element also needs the border property set!

Here, the middle sections of the image are repeated to create the border:

An image as a border!

Here is the code:

Example
#borderimg {
  border: 10px solid transparent;
  padding: 15px;
  border-image: url(border.png) 30 round;
}
Here, the middle sections of the image are stretched to create the border:

An image as a border!

Here is the code:

Example
#borderimg {
  border: 10px solid transparent;
  padding: 15px;
  border-image: url(border.png) 30 stretch;
}
Tip: The border-image property is actually a shorthand property for the border-image-source, border-image-slice, border-image-width, border-image-outset and border-image-repeat properties.

CSS border-image - Different Slice Values
Different slice values completely changes the look of the border:

Example 1:

border-image: url(border.png) 50 round;

Example 2:

border-image: url(border.png) 20% round;

Example 3:

border-image: url(border.png) 30% round;

Here is the code:

Example
#borderimg1 {
  border: 10px solid transparent;
  padding: 15px;
  border-image: url(border.png) 50 round;
}

#borderimg2 {
  border: 10px solid transparent;
  padding: 15px;
  border-image: url(border.png) 20% round;
}

#borderimg3 {
  border: 10px solid transparent;
  padding: 15px;
  border-image: url(border.png) 30% round;
}

CSS Border Image Properties
Property	Description
border-image	A shorthand property for setting all the border-image-* properties
border-image-source	Specifies the path to the image to be used as a border
border-image-slice	Specifies how to slice the border image
border-image-width	Specifies the widths of the border image
border-image-outset	Specifies the amount by which the border image area extends beyond the border box
border-image-repeat	Specifies whether the border image should be repeated, rounded or stretched

CSS Multiple Backgrounds
In this chapter you will learn how to add multiple background images to one element.

You will also learn about the following properties:

background-size
background-origin
background-clip
CSS Multiple Backgrounds
CSS allows you to add multiple background images for an element, through the background-image property.

The different background images are separated by commas, and the images are stacked on top of each other, where the first image is closest to the viewer.

The following example has two background images, the first image is a flower (aligned to the bottom and right) and the second image is a paper background (aligned to the top-left corner):

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style> 
#example1 {
  background-image: url(img_flwr.gif), url(paper.gif);
  background-position: right bottom, left top;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat;
  padding: 15px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Multiple Backgrounds</h1>
<p>The following div element has two background images:</p>

<div id="example1">
  <h1>Lorem Ipsum Dolor</h1>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.</p>
  <p>Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

Multiple background images can be specified using either the individual background properties (as above) or the background shorthand property.

The following example uses the background shorthand property (same result as example above):

Example
#example1 {
  background: url(img_flwr.gif) right bottom no-repeat, url(paper.gif) left top repeat;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

CSS Background Size
The CSS background-size property allows you to specify the size of background images.

The size can be specified in lengths, percentages, or by using one of the two keywords: contain or cover.

The following example resizes a background image to much smaller than the original image (using pixels):

Lorem Ipsum Dolor
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.

Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Here is the code:

Example
#div1 {
  background: url(img_flower.jpg);
  background-size: 100px 80px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
The two other possible values for background-size are contain and cover.

The contain keyword scales the background image to be as large as possible (but both its width and its height must fit inside the content area). As such, depending on the proportions of the background image and the background positioning area, there may be some areas of the background which are not covered by the background image.

The cover keyword scales the background image so that the content area is completely covered by the background image (both its width and height are equal to or exceed the content area). As such, some parts of the background image may not be visible in the background positioning area.

The following example illustrates the use of contain and cover:

Example
#div1 {
  background: url(img_flower.jpg);
  background-size: contain;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

#div2 {
  background: url(img_flower.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
Define Sizes of Multiple Background Images
The background-size property also accepts multiple values for background size (using a comma-separated list), when working with multiple backgrounds.

The following example has three background images specified, with different background-size value for each image:

Example
#example1 {
  background: url(img_tree.gif) left top no-repeat, url(img_flwr.gif) right bottom no-repeat, url(paper.gif) left top repeat;
  background-size: 50px, 130px, auto;
}
Full Size Background Image
Now we want to have a background image on a website that covers the entire browser window at all times.

The requirements are as follows:

Fill the entire page with the image (no white space)
Scale image as needed
Center image on page
Do not cause scrollbars
The following example shows how to do it; Use the <html> element (the <html> element is always at least the height of the browser window). Then set a fixed and centered background on it. Then adjust its size with the background-size property:

Example
html {
  background: url(img_man.jpg) no-repeat center fixed;
  background-size: cover;
}
Hero Image
You could also use different background properties on a <div> to create a hero image (a large image with text), and place it where you want.

Example
.hero-image {
  background: url(img_man.jpg) no-repeat center;
  background-size: cover;
  height: 500px;
  position: relative;
}
CSS background-origin Property
The CSS background-origin property specifies where the background image is positioned.

The property takes three different values:

border-box - the background image starts from the upper left corner of the border
padding-box - (default) the background image starts from the upper left corner of the padding edge
content-box - the background image starts from the upper left corner of the content
The following example illustrates the background-origin property:

Example
#example1 {
  border: 10px solid black;
  padding: 35px;
  background: url(img_flwr.gif);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-origin: content-box;
}
CSS background-clip Property
The CSS background-clip property specifies the painting area of the background.

The property takes three different values:

border-box - (default) the background is painted to the outside edge of the border
padding-box - the background is painted to the outside edge of the padding
content-box - the background is painted within the content box
The following example illustrates the background-clip property:

Example
#example1 {
  border: 10px dotted black;
  padding: 35px;
  background: yellow;
  background-clip: content-box;
}

CSS Advanced Background Properties
Property	Description
background	A shorthand property for setting all the background properties in one declaration
background-clip	Specifies the painting area of the background
background-image	Specifies one or more background images for an element
background-origin	Specifies where the background image(s) is/are positioned

                                                  CSS Colors

CSS supports 140+ color names, HEX values, RGB values, RGBA values, HSL values, HSLA values, and opacity.

RGBA Colors
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha). The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).

rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2);
rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.4);
rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.6);
rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8);
The following example defines different RGBA colors:

Example
#p1 {background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3);}  /* red with opacity */
#p2 {background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3);}  /* green with opacity */
#p3 {background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3);}  /* blue with opacity */

HSL Colors
HSL stands for Hue, Saturation and Lightness.

An HSL color value is specified with: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness).

Hue is a degree on the color wheel (from 0 to 360):
0 (or 360) is red
120 is green
240 is blue
Saturation is a percentage value: 100% is the full color.
Lightness is also a percentage; 0% is dark (black) and 100% is white.
hsl(0, 100%, 30%);
hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
hsl(0, 100%, 70%);
hsl(0, 100%, 90%);
The following example defines different HSL colors:

Example
#p1 {background-color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%);}  /* green */
#p2 {background-color: hsl(120, 100%, 75%);}  /* light green */
#p3 {background-color: hsl(120, 100%, 25%);}  /* dark green */
#p4 {background-color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);}   /* pastel green */
HSLA Colors
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An HSLA color value is specified with: hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha), where the alpha parameter defines the opacity. The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).

hsla(0, 100%, 30%, 0.3);
hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.3);
hsla(0, 100%, 70%, 0.3);
hsla(0, 100%, 90%, 0.3);
The following example defines different HSLA colors:

Example
#p1 {background-color: hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.3);}  /* green with opacity */
#p2 {background-color: hsla(120, 100%, 75%, 0.3);}  /* light green with opacity */
#p3 {background-color: hsla(120, 100%, 25%, 0.3);}  /* dark green with opacity */
#p4 {background-color: hsla(120, 60%, 70%, 0.3);}   /* pastel green with opacity */
Opacity
The CSS opacity property sets the opacity for the whole element (both background color and text will be opaque/transparent).

The opacity property value must be a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).

rgb(255, 0, 0);opacity:0.2;
rgb(255, 0, 0);opacity:0.4;
rgb(255, 0, 0);opacity:0.6;
rgb(255, 0, 0);opacity:0.8;
Notice that the text above will also be transparent/opaque!

The following example shows different elements with opacity:

Example
#p1 {background-color:rgb(255,0,0);opacity:0.6;}  /* red with opacity */
#p2 {background-color:rgb(0,255,0);opacity:0.6;}  /* green with opacity */
#p3 {background-color:rgb(0,0,255);opacity:0.6;}  /* blue with opacity */

                                              CSS Color Keywords

This page will explain the transparent, currentcolor, and inherit keywords.

The transparent Keyword
The transparent keyword is used to make a color transparent. This is often used to make a transparent background color for an element.

Example
Here, the background color of the <div> element will be fully transparent, and the background image will show through:

body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}

div {
  background-color: transparent;
}
Note: The transparent keyword is equivalent to rgba(0,0,0,0). RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. Read more in our CSS RGB chapter and in our CSS Colors chapter.

The currentcolor Keyword
The currentcolor keyword is like a variable that holds the current value of the color property of an element.

This keyword can be useful if you want a specific color to be consistent in an element or a page.

Example
In this example the border color of the <div> element will be blue, because the text color of the <div> element is blue:

div {
  color: blue;
  border: 10px solid currentcolor;
}
Example
In this example the <div>'s background color is set to the current color value of the body element:

body {
  color: purple;
}

div {
  background-color: currentcolor;
}
Example
In this example the <div>'s border color and shadow color is set to the current color value of the body element:

body {
 color: green;
}

div {
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 15px currentcolor;
  border: 5px solid currentcolor;
}
The inherit Keyword
The inherit keyword specifies that a property should inherit its value from its parent element.

The inherit keyword can be used for any CSS property, and on any HTML element.

Example
In this example the <span>'s border settings will be inherited from the parent element: 

div {
  border: 2px solid red;
}

span {
  border: inherit;
}

                                                      CSS Gradients

Gradient Backgrounds
CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

CSS defines three types of gradients:

Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)
CSS Linear Gradients
To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

Syntax
background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);
Direction - Top to Bottom (this is default)

The following example shows a linear gradient that starts at the top. It starts red, transitioning to yellow:

top to bottom (default)

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#grad1 {
  height: 200px;
  background-color: red; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Linear Gradient - Top to Bottom</h1>
<p>This linear gradient starts red at the top, transitioning to yellow at the bottom:</p>

<div id="grad1"></div>

</body>
</html>

Direction - Left to Right

The following example shows a linear gradient that starts from the left. It starts red, transitioning to yellow:

left to right
Example
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red , yellow);
}
Direction - Diagonal

You can make a gradient diagonally by specifying both the horizontal and vertical starting positions.

The following example shows a linear gradient that starts at top left (and goes to bottom right). It starts red, transitioning to yellow:

top left to bottom right
Example
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, yellow);
}

Using Angles
If you want more control over the direction of the gradient, you can define an angle, instead of the predefined directions (to bottom, to top, to right, to left, to bottom right, etc.). A value of 0deg is equivalent to "to top". A value of 90deg is equivalent to "to right". A value of 180deg is equivalent to "to bottom".

Syntax
background-image: linear-gradient(angle, color-stop1, color-stop2);
The following example shows how to use angles on linear gradients:

180deg
Example
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, red, yellow);
}
Using Multiple Color Stops
The following example shows a linear gradient (from top to bottom) with multiple color stops:

Example
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow, green);
}
The following example shows how to create a linear gradient (from left to right) with the color of the rainbow and some text:

Rainbow Background
Example
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red,orange,yellow,green,blue,indigo,violet);
}
Using Transparency
CSS gradients also support transparency, which can be used to create fading effects.

To add transparency, we use the rgba() function to define the color stops. The last parameter in the rgba() function can be a value from 0 to 1, and it defines the transparency of the color: 0 indicates full transparency, 1 indicates full color (no transparency).

The following example shows a linear gradient that starts from the left. It starts fully transparent, transitioning to full color red:

Example
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255,0,0,0), rgba(255,0,0,1));
}
Repeating a linear-gradient
The repeating-linear-gradient() function is used to repeat linear gradients:

Example
A repeating linear gradient:

#grad {
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 20%);
}
  
CSS Radial Gradients
  CSS Radial Gradients
  A radial gradient is defined by its center.
  
  To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.
  
  Syntax
  background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);
  By default, shape is ellipse, size is farthest-corner, and position is center.
  
  Radial Gradient - Evenly Spaced Color Stops (this is default)
  
  The following example shows a radial gradient with evenly spaced color stops:
  
  Example
  #grad {
    background-image: radial-gradient(red, yellow, green);
  }
  Radial Gradient - Differently Spaced Color Stops
  
  The following example shows a radial gradient with differently spaced color stops:
  
  Example
  #grad {
    background-image: radial-gradient(red 5%, yellow 15%, green 60%);
  }
  Set Shape
  The shape parameter defines the shape. It can take the value circle or ellipse. The default value is ellipse.
  
  The following example shows a radial gradient with the shape of a circle:
  
  Example
  #grad {
    background-image: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow, green);
  }
  
  Use of Different Size Keywords
  The size parameter defines the size of the gradient. It can take four values:
  
  closest-side
  farthest-side
  closest-corner
  farthest-corner
  Example
  A radial gradient with different size keywords:
  
  #grad1 {
    background-image: radial-gradient(closest-side at 60% 55%, red, yellow, black);
  }
  
  #grad2 {
    background-image: radial-gradient(farthest-side at 60% 55%, red, yellow, black);
  }
  Repeating a radial-gradient
  The repeating-radial-gradient() function is used to repeat radial gradients:
  
  Example
  A repeating radial gradient:
  
  #grad {
    background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 15%);
  }

  CSS Conic Gradients
  CSS Conic Gradients
  A conic gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.
  
  To create a conic gradient you must define at least two colors.
  
  Syntax
  background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...);
  By default, angle is 0deg and position is center.
  
  If no degree is specified, the colors will be spread equally around the center point.
  
  Conic Gradient: Three Colors
  The following example shows a conic gradient with three colors:
  
  Example
  A conic gradient with three colors:
  
  #grad {
    background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green);
  }
  Conic Gradient: Five Colors
  The following example shows a conic gradient with five colors:
  
  Example
  A conic gradient with five colors:
  
  #grad {
    background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green, blue, black);
  }
  
  Conic Gradient: Three Colors and Degrees
  The following example shows a conic gradient with three colors and a degree for each color:
  
  Example
  A conic gradient with three colors and a degree for each color:
  
  #grad {
    background-image: conic-gradient(red 45deg, yellow 90deg, green 210deg);
  }
  ADVERTISEMENT
  
  Create Pie Charts
  Just add border-radius: 50% to make the conic gradient look like a pie:
  
  Example
  #grad {
    background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green, blue, black);
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  Here is another pie chart with defined degrees for all the colors:
  
  Example
  #grad {
    background-image: conic-gradient(red 0deg, red 90deg, yellow 90deg, yellow 180deg, green 180deg, green 270deg, blue 270deg);
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  Conic Gradient With Specified From Angle
  The [from angle] specifies an angle that the entire conic gradient is rotated by.
  
  The following example shows a conic gradient with a from angle of 90deg:
  
  Example
  A conic gradient with a from angle:
  
  #grad {
    background-image: conic-gradient(from 90deg, red, yellow, green);
  }
  Conic Gradient With Specified Center Position
  The [at position] specifies the center of the conic gradient.
  
  The following example shows a conic gradient with a center position of 60% 45%:
  
  Example
  A conic gradient with a specified center position:
  
  #grad {
    background-image: conic-gradient(at 60% 45%, red, yellow, green);
  }
  Repeating a Conic Gradient
  The repeating-conic-gradient() function is used to repeat conic gradients:
  
  Example
  A repeating conic gradient:
  
  #grad {
    background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(red 10%, yellow 20%);
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  Here is a repeating conic gradient with defined color-starts and color-stops:
  
  Example
  A repeating conic gradient with defined color-starts and color-stops:
  
  #grad {
    background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(red 0deg 10deg, yellow 10deg 20deg, blue 20deg 30deg);
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

CSS Shadow Effects
With CSS you can add shadow to text and to elements.

In these chapters you will learn about the following properties:

text-shadow
box-shadow
CSS Text Shadow
The CSS text-shadow property applies shadow to text.

In its simplest use, you only specify the horizontal shadow (2px) and the vertical shadow (2px):

Text shadow effect!
Example
h1 {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px;
}
Next, add a color to the shadow:

Text shadow effect!
Example
h1 {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px red;
}
Then, add a blur effect to the shadow:

Text shadow effect!
Example
h1 {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red;
}
The following example shows a white text with black shadow:

Text shadow effect!
Example
h1 {
  color: white;
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;
}
The following example shows a red neon glow shadow:

Text shadow effect!
Example
h1 {
  text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000;
}

Multiple Shadows
To add more than one shadow to the text, you can add a comma-separated list of shadows.

The following example shows a red and blue neon glow shadow:

Text shadow effect!
Example
h1 {
  text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000, 0 0 5px #0000FF;
}
The following example shows a white text with black, blue, and darkblue shadow:

Text shadow effect!
Example
h1 {
  color: white;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black, 0 0 25px blue, 0 0 5px darkblue;
}
You can also use the text-shadow property to create a plain border around some text (without shadows):

Border around text!
Example
h1 {
  color: coral;
  text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 1px black, 1px 0 black, 0 -1px black;
}

CSS Box Shadow
CSS box-shadow Property
The CSS box-shadow property is used to apply one or more shadows to an element.

Specify a Horizontal and a Vertical Shadow
In its simplest use, you only specify a horizontal and a vertical shadow. The default color of the shadow is the current text-color.

A <div> element with a box-shadow
Example
Specify a horizontal and a vertical shadow:

div {
  box-shadow: 10px 10px;
}
Specify a Color for the Shadow
The color parameter defines the color of the shadow.

A <div> element with a lightblue box-shadow
Example
Specify a color for the shadow:

div {
  box-shadow: 10px 10px lightblue;
}
Add a Blur Effect to the Shadow
The blur parameter defines the blur radius. The higher the number, the more blurred the shadow will be.

A <div> element with a 5px blurred, lightblue box-shadow
Example
Add a blur effect to the shadow:

div {
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px lightblue;
}
Set the Spread Radius of the Shadow
The spread parameter defines the spread radius. A positive value increases the size of the shadow, a negative value decreases the size of the shadow.

A <div> element with a blurred, lightblue box-shadow, with a spread radius of 12px
Example
Set the spread radius of the shadow:

div {
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 12px lightblue;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

Set the inset Parameter
The inset parameter changes the shadow from an outer shadow (outset) to an inner shadow.

A <div> element with a blurred, lightblue, inset box-shadow
Example
Add the inset parameter:

div {
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px lightblue inset;
}
Add Multiple Shadows
An element can also have multiple shadows:

Example
div {
  box-shadow: 5px 5px blue, 10px 10px red, 15px 15px green;
}
Cards
You can also use the box-shadow property to create paper-like cards:

Example
div.card {
  width: 250px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);
  text-align: center;
}

CSS Text Overflow, Word Wrap, Line Breaking Rules, and Writing Modes
In this chapter you will learn about the following properties:

text-overflow
word-wrap
word-break
writing-mode
CSS Text Overflow
The CSS text-overflow property specifies how overflowed content that is not displayed should be signaled to the user.

It can be clipped:

This is some long text that will not fit in the box

or it can be rendered as an ellipsis (...):

This is some long text that will not fit in the box

The CSS code is as follows:

Example
p.test1 {
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 200px;
  border: 1px solid #000000;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: clip;
}

p.test2 {
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 200px;
  border: 1px solid #000000;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
The following example shows how you can display the overflowed content when hovering over the element:

Example
div.test:hover {
  overflow: visible;
}

CSS Word Wrapping
The CSS word-wrap property allows long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next line. 

If a word is too long to fit within an area, it expands outside:

This paragraph contains a very long word: thisisaveryveryveryveryveryverylongword. The long word will break and wrap to the next line.

The word-wrap property allows you to force the text to wrap - even if it means splitting it in the middle of a word:

This paragraph contains a very long word: thisisaveryveryveryveryveryverylongword. The long word will break and wrap to the next line.

The CSS code is as follows:

Example
Allow long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next line:

p {
  word-wrap: break-word;
}
CSS Word Breaking
The CSS word-break property specifies line breaking rules.

This paragraph contains some text. This line will-break-at-hyphens.

This paragraph contains some text. The lines will break at any character.

The CSS code is as follows:

Example
p.test1 {
  word-break: keep-all;
}

p.test2 {
  word-break: break-all;
}
CSS Writing Mode
The CSS writing-mode property specifies whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically.

Some text with a span element with a vertical-rl writing-mode.

The following example shows some different writing modes:

Example
p.test1 {
  writing-mode: horizontal-tb;
}

span.test2 {
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
}

p.test2 {
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
}

CSS Text Effect Properties
The following table lists the CSS text effect properties:

Property	Description
text-justify	Specifies how justified text should be aligned and spaced
text-overflow	Specifies how overflowed content that is not displayed should be signaled to the user
word-break	Specifies line breaking rules for non-CJK scripts
word-wrap	Allows long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next line
writing-mode	Specifies whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically

CSS Web Fonts
The CSS @font-face Rule
Web fonts allow Web designers to use fonts that are not installed on the user's computer.

When you have found/bought the font you wish to use, just include the font file on your web server, and it will be automatically downloaded to the user when needed.

Your "own" fonts are defined within the CSS @font-face rule.

Different Font Formats
TrueType Fonts (TTF)

TrueType is a font standard developed in the late 1980s, by Apple and Microsoft. TrueType is the most common font format for both the Mac OS and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

OpenType Fonts (OTF)

OpenType is a format for scalable computer fonts. It was built on TrueType, and is a registered trademark of Microsoft. OpenType fonts are used commonly today on the major computer platforms.

The Web Open Font Format (WOFF)

WOFF is a font format for use in web pages. It was developed in 2009, and is now a W3C Recommendation. WOFF is essentially OpenType or TrueType with compression and additional metadata. The goal is to support font distribution from a server to a client over a network with bandwidth constraints.

The Web Open Font Format (WOFF 2.0)

TrueType/OpenType font that provides better compression than WOFF 1.0.

SVG Fonts/Shapes

SVG fonts allow SVG to be used as glyphs when displaying text. The SVG 1.1 specification define a font module that allows the creation of fonts within an SVG document. You can also apply CSS to SVG documents, and the @font-face rule can be applied to text in SVG documents.

Embedded OpenType Fonts (EOT)

EOT fonts are a compact form of OpenType fonts designed by Microsoft for use as embedded fonts on web pages.

Browser Support for Font Formats
The numbers in the table specifies the first browser version that fully supports the font format.

Font format					
TTF/OTF	9.0*	4.0	3.5	3.1	10.0
WOFF	9.0	5.0	3.6	5.1	11.1
WOFF2	14.0	36.0	39.0	10.0	26.0
SVG	Not supported	Not supported	Not supported	3.2	Not supported
EOT	6.0	Not supported	Not supported	Not supported	Not supported
*IE: The font format only works when set to be "installable".

Using The Font You Want
In the @font-face rule; first define a name for the font (e.g. myFirstFont) and then point to the font file.

Tip: Always use lowercase letters for the font URL. Uppercase letters can give unexpected results in IE.

To use the font for an HTML element, refer to the name of the font (myFirstFont) through the font-family property:

Example
@font-face {
  font-family: myFirstFont;
  src: url(sansation_light.woff);
}

div {
  font-family: myFirstFont;
}
Using Bold Text
You must add another @font-face rule containing descriptors for bold text:

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style> 
@font-face {
   font-family: myFirstFont;
   src: url(sansation_light.woff);
}

@font-face {
   font-family: myFirstFont;
   src: url(sansation_bold.woff);
   font-weight: bold;
}

* {
   font-family: myFirstFont;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>The @font-face Rule</h1>

<div>
With CSS, websites can use <b>fonts other than the pre-selected "web-safe" fonts</b>.
</div>

</body>
</html>


The file "sansation_bold.woff" is another font file, that contains the bold characters for the Sansation font.

Browsers will use this whenever a piece of text with the font-family "myFirstFont" should render as bold.

This way you can have many @font-face rules for the same font.

CSS Font Descriptors
The following table lists all the font descriptors that can be defined inside the @font-face rule:

Descriptor	Values	Description
font-family	name	Required. Defines a name for the font
src	URL	Required. Defines the URL of the font file
font-stretch	normal
condensed
ultra-condensed
extra-condensed
semi-condensed
expanded
semi-expanded
extra-expanded
ultra-expanded	Optional. Defines how the font should be stretched. Default is "normal"
font-style	normal
italic
oblique	Optional. Defines how the font should be styled. Default is "normal"
font-weight	normal
bold
100
200
300
400
500
600
700
800
900	Optional. Defines the boldness of the font. Default is "normal"
unicode-range	unicode-range	Optional. Defines the range of UNICODE characters the font supports. Default is "U+0-10FFFF"

                                                  CSS 2D Transforms

CSS 2D Transforms
CSS transforms allow you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements.

Mouse over the element below to see a 2D transformation:

2D rotate
In this chapter you will learn about the following CSS property:

transform
Browser Support
The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the property.

Property					
transform	36.0
10.0
16.0

23.0
CSS 2D Transforms Methods
With the CSS transform property you can use the following 2D transformation methods:

translate()
rotate()
scaleX()
scaleY()
scale()
skewX()
skewY()
skew()
matrix()
Tip: You will learn about 3D transformations in the next chapter.

The translate() Method
Translate
The translate() method moves an element from its current position (according to the parameters given for the X-axis and the Y-axis).

The following example moves the <div> element 50 pixels to the right, and 100 pixels down from its current position:

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style> 
div {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
  transform: translate(50px,100px);
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>The translate() Method</h1>
<p>The translate() method moves an element from its current position:</p>

<div>
This div element is moved 50 pixels to the right, and 100 pixels down from its current position.
</div>

</body>
</html>


The rotate() Method
Rotate
The rotate() method rotates an element clockwise or counter-clockwise according to a given degree.

The following example rotates the <div> element clockwise with 20 degrees:

Example
div {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
Using negative values will rotate the element counter-clockwise.

The following example rotates the <div> element counter-clockwise with 20 degrees:

Example
div {
  transform: rotate(-20deg);
}
ADVERTISEMENT

The scale() Method
Scale
The scale() method increases or decreases the size of an element (according to the parameters given for the width and height).

The following example increases the <div> element to be two times of its original width, and three times of its original height: 

Example
div {
  transform: scale(2, 3);
}
The following example decreases the <div> element to be half of its original width and height: 

Example
div {
  transform: scale(0.5, 0.5);
}
The scaleX() Method
The scaleX() method increases or decreases the width of an element.

The following example increases the <div> element to be two times of its original width: 

Example
div {
  transform: scaleX(2);
}
The following example decreases the <div> element to be half of its original width: 

Example
div {
  transform: scaleX(0.5);
}
The scaleY() Method
The scaleY() method increases or decreases the height of an element.

The following example increases the <div> element to be three times of its original height: 

Example
div {
  transform: scaleY(3);
}
The following example decreases the <div> element to be half of its original height: 

Example
div {
  transform: scaleY(0.5);
}
The skewX() Method
The skewX() method skews an element along the X-axis by the given angle.

The following example skews the <div> element 20 degrees along the X-axis:

Example
div {
  transform: skewX(20deg);
}
The skewY() Method
The skewY() method skews an element along the Y-axis by the given angle.

The following example skews the <div> element 20 degrees along the Y-axis:

Example
div {
  transform: skewY(20deg);
}
The skew() Method
The skew() method skews an element along the X and Y-axis by the given angles.

The following example skews the <div> element 20 degrees along the X-axis, and 10 degrees along the Y-axis:

Example
div {
  transform: skew(20deg, 10deg);
}
If the second parameter is not specified, it has a zero value. So, the following example skews the <div> element 20 degrees along the X-axis:

Example
div {
  transform: skew(20deg);
}
The matrix() Method
Rotate
The matrix() method combines all the 2D transform methods into one.

The matrix() method take six parameters, containing mathematic functions, which allows you to rotate, scale, move (translate), and skew elements.

The parameters are as follow: matrix(scaleX(),skewY(),skewX(),scaleY(),translateX(),translateY())

Example
div {
  transform: matrix(1, -0.3, 0, 1, 0, 0);
}

                                            CSS Transitions

CSS Transitions
CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

Mouse over the element below to see a CSS transition effect:

CSS
In this chapter you will learn about the following properties:

transition
transition-delay
transition-duration
transition-property
transition-timing-function

How to Use CSS Transitions?
To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

the CSS property you want to add an effect to
the duration of the effect
Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.

The following example shows a 100px * 100px red <div> element. The <div> element has also specified a transition effect for the width property, with a duration of 2 seconds:

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  transition: width 2s;
}

The transition effect will start when the specified CSS property (width) changes value.

Now, let us specify a new value for the width property when a user mouses over the <div> element:

Example
div:hover {
  width: 300px;
}

Examples combine

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style> 
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  transition: width 2s;
}

div:hover {
  width: 300px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>The transition Property</h1>

<p>Hover over the div element below, to see the transition effect:</p>
<div></div>

</body>
</html>

Notice that when the cursor mouses out of the element, it will gradually change back to its original style.

Change Several Property Values
The following example adds a transition effect for both the width and height property, with a duration of 2 seconds for the width and 4 seconds for the height:

Example
div {
  transition: width 2s, height 4s;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition
The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
The following example shows some of the different speed curves that can be used:

Example
#div1 {transition-timing-function: linear;}
#div2 {transition-timing-function: ease;}
#div3 {transition-timing-function: ease-in;}
#div4 {transition-timing-function: ease-out;}
#div5 {transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;}
Delay the Transition Effect
The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.

The following example has a 1 second delay before starting:

Example
div {
  transition-delay: 1s;
}
Transition + Transformation
The following example adds a transition effect to the transformation:

Example
div {
  transition: width 2s, height 2s, transform 2s;
}
More Transition Examples
The CSS transition properties can be specified one by one, like this:

Example
div {
  transition-property: width;
  transition-duration: 2s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
  transition-delay: 1s;
}
or by using the shorthand property transition:

Example
div {
  transition: width 2s linear 1s;
}

CSS Transition Properties
The following table lists all the CSS transition properties:

Property	Description
transition	A shorthand property for setting the four transition properties into a single property
transition-delay	Specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect
transition-duration	Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete

What are CSS Animations?
An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.

To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

The @keyframes Rule
When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.

To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.

The following example binds the "example" animation to the <div> element. The animation will last for 4 seconds, and it will gradually change the background-color of the <div> element from "red" to "yellow":

Example
/* The animation code */
@keyframes example {
  from {background-color: red;}
  to {background-color: yellow;}
}

/* The element to apply the animation to */
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}
Note: The animation-duration property defines how long an animation should take to complete. If the animation-duration property is not specified, no animation will occur, because the default value is 0s (0 seconds). 

In the example above we have specified when the style will change by using the keywords "from" and "to" (which represents 0% (start) and 100% (complete)).

It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many style changes as you like.

The following example will change the background-color of the <div> element when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete:

Example
/* The animation code */
@keyframes example {
  0%   {background-color: red;}
  25%  {background-color: yellow;}
  50%  {background-color: blue;}
  100% {background-color: green;}
}

/* The element to apply the animation to */
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}
The following example will change both the background-color and the position of the <div> element when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete:

Example
/* The animation code */
@keyframes example {
  0%   {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
  25%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:0px;}
  50%  {background-color:blue; left:200px; top:200px;}
  75%  {background-color:green; left:0px; top:200px;}
  100% {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
}

/* The element to apply the animation to */
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}

Delay an Animation
The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.

The following example has a 2 seconds delay before starting the animation:

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-delay: 2s;
}
Negative values are also allowed. If using negative values, the animation will start as if it had already been playing for N seconds.

In the following example, the animation will start as if it had already been playing for 2 seconds:

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-delay: -2s;
}
Set How Many Times an Animation Should Run
The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run.

The following example will run the animation 3 times before it stops:

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-iteration-count: 3;
}
The following example uses the value "infinite" to make the animation continue forever:

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
Run Animation in Reverse Direction or Alternate Cycles
The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.

The animation-direction property can have the following values:

normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards
The following example will run the animation in reverse direction (backwards):

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-direction: reverse;
}
The following example uses the value "alternate" to make the animation run forwards first, then backwards:

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-iteration-count: 2;
  animation-direction: alternate;
}
The following example uses the value "alternate-reverse" to make the animation run backwards first, then forwards:

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-iteration-count: 2;
  animation-direction: alternate-reverse;
}
Specify the Speed Curve of the Animation
The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.

The animation-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
The following example shows some of the different speed curves that can be used:

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style> 
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
  position: relative;
  animation: mymove 5s infinite;
}

#div1 {animation-timing-function: linear;}
#div2 {animation-timing-function: ease;}
#div3 {animation-timing-function: ease-in;}
#div4 {animation-timing-function: ease-out;}
#div5 {animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;}

@keyframes mymove {
  from {left: 0px;}
  to {left: 300px;}
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>CSS Animation</h1>

<p>The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation. The following example shows some of the different speed curves that can be used:</p>

<div id="div1">linear</div>
<div id="div2">ease</div>
<div id="div3">ease-in</div>
<div id="div4">ease-out</div>
<div id="div5">ease-in-out</div>

</body>
</html>

Specify the fill-mode For an Animation
CSS animations do not affect an element before the first keyframe is played or after the last keyframe is played. The animation-fill-mode property can override this behavior.

The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).

The animation-fill-mode property can have the following values:

none - Default value. Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing
forwards - The element will retain the style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)
backwards - The element will get the style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period
both - The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation properties in both directions
The following example lets the <div> element retain the style values from the last keyframe when the animation ends:

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  position: relative;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}
The following example lets the <div> element get the style values set by the first keyframe before the animation starts (during the animation-delay period):

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  position: relative;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-delay: 2s;
  animation-fill-mode: backwards;
}
The following example lets the <div> element get the style values set by the first keyframe before the animation starts, and retain the style values from the last keyframe when the animation ends:

Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  position: relative;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-delay: 2s;
  animation-fill-mode: both;
}
Animation Shorthand Property
The example below uses six of the animation properties:

Example
div {
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 5s;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
  animation-delay: 2s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
}
The same animation effect as above can be achieved by using the shorthand animation property:

Example
div {
  animation: example 5s linear 2s infinite alternate;
}

Create tooltips with CSS.

Demo: Tooltip Examples
A tooltip is often used to specify extra information about something when the user moves the mouse pointer over an element:

TopRightBottomLeft
Basic Tooltip
Create a tooltip that appears when the user moves the mouse over an element:

Example
<style>
/* Tooltip container */
.tooltip {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
  border-bottom: 1px dotted black; /* If you want dots under the hoverable text */
}

/* Tooltip text */
.tooltip .tooltiptext {
  visibility: hidden;
  width: 120px;
  background-color: black;
  color: #fff;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 5px 0;
  border-radius: 6px;
 
  /* Position the tooltip text - see examples below! */
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
}

/* Show the tooltip text when you mouse over the tooltip container */
.tooltip:hover .tooltiptext {
  visibility: visible;
}
</style>

<div class="tooltip">Hover over me
  <span class="tooltiptext">Tooltip text</span>
</div>
Example Explained
HTML: Use a container element (like <div>) and add the "tooltip" class to it. When the user mouse over this <div>, it will show the tooltip text.

The tooltip text is placed inside an inline element (like <span>) with class="tooltiptext".

CSS: The tooltip class use position:relative, which is needed to position the tooltip text (position:absolute). Note: See examples below on how to position the tooltip.

The tooltiptext class holds the actual tooltip text. It is hidden by default, and will be visible on hover (see below). We have also added some basic styles to it: 120px width, black background color, white text color, centered text, and 5px top and bottom padding.

The CSS border-radius property is used to add rounded corners to the tooltip text.

The :hover selector is used to show the tooltip text when the user moves the mouse over the <div> with class="tooltip".

Positioning Tooltips
In this example, the tooltip is placed to the right (left:105%) of the "hoverable" text (<div>). Also note that top:-5px is used to place it in the middle of its container element. We use the number 5 because the tooltip text has a top and bottom padding of 5px. If you increase its padding, also increase the value of the top property to ensure that it stays in the middle (if this is something you want). The same applies if you want the tooltip placed to the left.

Right Tooltip
.tooltip .tooltiptext {
  top: -5px;
  left: 105%;
}
Result:

Hover over me
Left Tooltip
.tooltip .tooltiptext {
  top: -5px;
  right: 105%;
}
Result:

Hover over me
If you want the tooltip to appear on top or on the bottom, see examples below. Note that we use the margin-left property with a value of minus 60 pixels. This is to center the tooltip above/below the hoverable text. It is set to the half of the tooltip's width (120/2 = 60).

Top Tooltip
.tooltip .tooltiptext {
  width: 120px;
  bottom: 100%;
  left: 50%;
  margin-left: -60px; /* Use half of the width (120/2 = 60), to center the tooltip */
}
Result:

Hover over me
Bottom Tooltip
.tooltip .tooltiptext {
  width: 120px;
  top: 100%;
  left: 50%;
  margin-left: -60px; /* Use half of the width (120/2 = 60), to center the tooltip */
}
Result:

Hover over me
Tooltip Arrows
To create an arrow that should appear from a specific side of the tooltip, add "empty" content after tooltip, with the pseudo-element class ::after together with the content property. The arrow itself is created using borders. This will make the tooltip look like a speech bubble.

This example demonstrates how to add an arrow to the bottom of the tooltip:

Bottom Arrow
.tooltip .tooltiptext::after {
  content: " ";
  position: absolute;
  top: 100%; /* At the bottom of the tooltip */
  left: 50%;
  margin-left: -5px;
  border-width: 5px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: black transparent transparent transparent;
}
Result:

Hover over me
Example Explained
Position the arrow inside the tooltip: top: 100% will place the arrow at the bottom of the tooltip. left: 50% will center the arrow.

Note: The border-width property specifies the size of the arrow. If you change this, also change the margin-left value to the same. This will keep the arrow centered.

The border-color is used to transform the content into an arrow. We set the top border to black, and the rest to transparent. If all sides were black, you would end up with a black square box.

This example demonstrates how to add an arrow to the top of the tooltip. Notice that we set the bottom border color this time:

Top Arrow
.tooltip .tooltiptext::after {
  content: " ";
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 100%;  /* At the top of the tooltip */
  left: 50%;
  margin-left: -5px;
  border-width: 5px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: transparent transparent black transparent;
}
Result:

Hover over me
This example demonstrates how to add an arrow to the left of the tooltip:

Left Arrow
.tooltip .tooltiptext::after {
  content: " ";
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  right: 100%; /* To the left of the tooltip */
  margin-top: -5px;
  border-width: 5px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: transparent black transparent transparent;
}
Result:

Hover over me
This example demonstrates how to add an arrow to the right of the tooltip:

Right Arrow
.tooltip .tooltiptext::after {
  content: " ";
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 100%; /* To the right of the tooltip */
  margin-top: -5px;
  border-width: 5px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: transparent transparent transparent black;
}
Result:

Hover over me
Fade In Tooltips (Animation)
If you want to fade in the tooltip text when it is about to be visible, you can use the CSS transition property together with the opacity property, and go from being completely invisible to 100% visible, in a number of specified seconds (1 second in our example):

Example
.tooltip .tooltiptext {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 1s;
}

.tooltip:hover .tooltiptext {
  opacity: 1;
}

Image Modal (Advanced)
This is an example to demonstrate how CSS and JavaScript can work together.

First, use CSS to create a modal window (dialog box), and hide it by default.

Then, use a JavaScript to show the modal window and to display the image inside the modal, when a user clicks on the image:

Northern Lights, Norway
Example
// Get the modal
var modal = document.getElementById('myModal');

// Get the image and insert it inside the modal - use its "alt" text as a caption
var img = document.getElementById('myImg');
var modalImg = document.getElementById("img01");
var captionText = document.getElementById("caption");
img.onclick = function(){
  modal.style.display = "block";
  modalImg.src = this.src;
  captionText.innerHTML = this.alt;
}

// Get the <span> element that closes the modal
var span = document.getElementsByClassName("close")[0];

// When the user clicks on <span> (x), close the modal
span.onclick = function() {
  modal.style.display = "none";
}

                                                          CSS Image Reflection

In this chapter you will learn how to reflect an image.


CSS Image Reflections
The box-reflect property is used to create an image reflection.

The value of the box-reflect property can be: below, above, left , or right.

Browser Support
The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the property.

Numbers followed by -webkit- specify the first version that worked with a prefix.

Property					
box-reflect	4.0 -webkit-	79.0 -webkit-	Not supported	4.0 -webkit-	15.0 -webkit-
ADVERTISEMENT

Examples
Example
Here we want the reflection below the image:

img {
  -webkit-box-reflect: below;
}
Example
Here we want the reflection to the right of the image:

img {
  -webkit-box-reflect: right;
}
CSS Reflection Offset
To specify the gap between the image and the reflection, add the size of the gap to the box-reflect property.

Example
Here we want the reflection below the image, with a 20px offset:

img {
  -webkit-box-reflect: below 20px;
}
CSS Reflection With Gradient
We can also create a fade-out effect on the reflection.

Example
Create a fade-out effect on the reflection:

img {
  -webkit-box-reflect: below 0px linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.0), rgba(0,0,0,0.4));
}

                                              CSS The object-fit Property

The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container.

The CSS object-fit Property
The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container.

This property tells the content to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible".

Look at the following image from Paris. This image is 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels high:

Paris
However, if we style the image above to be half its width (200 pixels) and same height (300 pixels), it will look like this:

Paris
Example
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
}
We see that the image is being squished to fit the container of 200x300 pixels (its original aspect ratio is destroyed).

Here is where the object-fit property comes in. The object-fit property can take one of the following values:

fill - This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit
contain - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension
cover - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit
none - The image is not resized
scale-down - the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain
Using object-fit: cover;
If we use object-fit: cover; the image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit:

Paris
Example
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

Using object-fit: contain;
If we use object-fit: contain; the image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension:

Paris
Example
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: contain;
}
Using object-fit: fill;
If we use object-fit: fill; the image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit:

Paris
Example
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: fill;
}
Using object-fit: none;
If we use object-fit: none; the image is not resized:

Paris
Example
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: none;
}
Using object-fit: scale-down;
If we use object-fit: scale-down; the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain:

Paris
Example
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: scale-down;
}
Another Example
Here we have two images and we want them to fill the width of 50% of the browser window and 100% of the height.

In the following example we do NOT use object-fit, so when we resize the browser window, the aspect ratio of the images will be destroyed:

Example
NorwayParis
In the next example, we use object-fit: cover;, so when we resize the browser window, the aspect ratio of the images is preserved:

Example
NorwayParis
 CSS object-fit More Examples
The following example demonstrates all the possible values of the object-fit property in one example:

Example
.fill {object-fit: fill;}
.contain {object-fit: contain;}
.cover {object-fit: cover;}
.scale-down {object-fit: scale-down;}
.none {object-fit: none;}
CSS Object-* Properties
The following table lists the CSS object-* properties:

Property	Description
object-fit	Specifies how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container
object-position	Specifies how an <img> or <video> should be positioned with x/y coordinates inside its "own content box"

                                                CSS The object-position Property

The CSS object-position property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be positioned within its container.

The Image
Look at the following image from Paris, which is 400x300 pixels:

Paris
Next, we use object-fit: cover; to keep the aspect ratio and to fill the given dimension. However, the image will be clipped to fit, like this:

Paris
Example
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

Using the object-position Property
Let's say that the part of the image that is shown, is not positioned as we want. To position the image, we will use the object-position property.

Here we will use the object-position property to position the image so that the great old building is in center:

Paris
Example
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: 80% 100%;
}
Here we will use the object-position property to position the image so that the famous Eiffel Tower is in center:

Paris
Example
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: 15% 100%;
}
CSS Object-* Properties
The following table lists the CSS object-* properties:

Property	Description
object-fit	Specifies how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container
object-posititon	Specifies how an <img> or <video> should be positioned with x/y coordinates inside its "own content box"

                                                          CSS Masking

With CSS masking you create a mask layer to place over an element to partially or fully hide portions of the element.

The CSS mask-image Property
The CSS mask-image property specifies a mask layer image.

The mask layer image can be a PNG image, an SVG image, a CSS gradient, or an SVG <mask> element.

Browser Support
Note: Most browsers only have partial support for CSS masking. You will need to use the -webkit- prefix in addition to the standard property in most browsers.

The numbers in the table below specify the first browser version that fully supports the property. Numbers followed by -webkit- specify the first version that worked with a prefix.

Property					
mask-image	4.0 -webkit-	79.0 -webkit-	53.0	4.0 -webkit-	15.0 -webkit-
Use an Image as the Mask Layer
To use a PNG or an SVG image as the mask layer, use a url() value to pass in the mask layer image.

The mask image needs to have a transparent or semi-transparent area. Black indicates fully transparent.

Here is the mask image (a PNG image) we will use:

W3Schools.com
Here is an image from Cinque Terre, in Italy:

Cinque Terre
Now, we apply the mask image (the PNG image above) as the mask layer for the image from Cinque Terre, Italy:

Cinque Terre
Example
Here is the source code:

.mask1 {
  -webkit-mask-image: url(w3logo.png);
  mask-image: url(w3logo.png);
  -webkit-mask-repeat: no-repeat;
  mask-repeat: no-repeat;
}
Example Explained
The mask-image property specifies the image to be used as a mask layer for an element.

The mask-repeat property specifies if or how a mask image will be repeated. The no-repeat value indicates that the mask image will not be repeated (the mask image will only be shown once).

Another Example
If we omit the mask-repeat property, the mask image will be repeated all over the image from Cinque Terre, Italy:

Cinque Terre
Example
Here is the source code:

.mask1 {
  -webkit-mask-image: url(w3logo.png);
  mask-image: url(w3logo.png);
}

Use Gradients as the Mask Layer
CSS linear and radial gradients can also be used as mask images.

Linear Gradient Examples
Here, we use a linear-gradient as the mask layer for our image. This linear gradient goes from top (black) to bottom (transparent):

Cinque Terre
 
Example
Use a linear gradient as a mask layer:

.mask1 {
  -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(black, transparent);
  mask-image: linear-gradient(black, transparent);
}
Here, we use a linear-gradient along with text masking as the mask layer for our image:

The Cinque Terre is a coastal area within Liguria, in the northwest of Italy. It lies in the west of La Spezia Province, and comprises five villages: Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore.

The Cinque Terre is a coastal area within Liguria, in the northwest of Italy. It lies in the west of La Spezia Province, and comprises five villages: Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore.

The Cinque Terre is a coastal area within Liguria, in the northwest of Italy. It lies in the west of La Spezia Province, and comprises five villages: Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore.

Example
Use a linear gradient along with text masking as a mask layer:

.mask1 {
  max-width: 600px;
  height: 350px;
  overflow-y: scroll;
  background: url(img_5terre.jpg) no-repeat;
  -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(black, transparent);
  mask-image: linear-gradient (black, transparent);
}
Radial Gradient Examples
Here, we use a radial-gradient (shaped as a circle) as the mask layer for our image:

Cinque Terre
Example
Use a radial gradient as a mask layer (a circle):

.mask2 {
  -webkit-mask-image: radial-gradient(circle, black 50%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 50%);
  mask-image: radial-gradient(circle, black 50%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 50%);
}
Here, we use a radial-gradient (shaped as an ellipse) as the mask layer for our image:

Cinque Terre
Example
Use another radial gradient as a mask layer (an ellipse):

.mask3 {
  -webkit-mask-image: radial-gradient(ellipse, black 50%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 50%);
  mask-image: radial-gradient(ellipse, black 50%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
}
Use SVG as the Mask Layer
The SVG <mask> element can be used inside an SVG graphic to create masking effects.

Here, we use the SVG <mask> element to create different mask layers for our image:

Example
An SVG mask layer (formed as a triangle):

<svg width="600" height="400">
  <mask id="svgmask1">
    <polygon fill="#ffffff" points="200 0, 400 400, 0 400"></polygon>
  </mask>
  <image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="img_5terre.jpg" mask="url(#svgmask1)"></image>
</svg>
Example
An SVG mask layer (formed as a star):

<svg width="600" height="400">
  <mask id="svgmask2">
    <polygon fill="#ffffff" points="100,10 40,198 190,78 10,78 160,198"></polygon>
  </mask>
  <image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="img_5terre.jpg" mask="url(#svgmask2)"></image>
</svg>
Example
An SVG mask layer (formed as circles):

<svg width="600" height="400">
  <mask id="svgmask3">
    <circle fill="#ffffff" cx="75" cy="75" r="75"></circle>
    <circle fill="#ffffff" cx="80" cy="260" r="75"></circle>
    <circle fill="#ffffff" cx="270" cy="160" r="75"></circle>
  </mask>
  <image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="img_5terre.jpg" mask="url(#svgmask3)"></image>
</svg>
CSS Masking Properties
The following table lists all the CSS masking properties:

Property	Description
mask-image	Specifies an image to be used as a mask layer for an element
mask-mode	Specifies whether the mask layer image is treated as a luminance mask or as an alpha mask
mask-origin	Specifies the origin position (the mask position area) of a mask layer image
mask-position	Sets the starting position of a mask layer image (relative to the mask position area)
mask-repeat	Specifies how the mask layer image is repeated
mask-size	Specifies the size of a mask layer image

Learn how to create a responsive pagination using CSS.

Simple Pagination
If you have a website with lots of pages, you may wish to add some sort of pagination to each page:

«123456»❮    ❯
Example
.pagination {
  display: inline-block;
}

.pagination a {
  color: black;
  float: left;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}
Active and Hoverable Pagination
«1234567»
Highlight the current page with an .active class, and use the :hover selector to change the color of each page link when moving the mouse over them:

Example
.pagination a.active {
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
}

.pagination a:hover:not(.active) {background-color: #ddd;}
Rounded Active and Hoverable Buttons
«1234567»
Add the border-radius property if you want a rounded "active" and "hover" button:

CSS Create Multiple Columns
The column-count property specifies the number of columns an element should be divided into.

The following example will divide the text in the <div> element into 3 columns: 

Example
div {
  column-count: 3;
}
CSS Specify the Gap Between Columns
The column-gap property specifies the gap between the columns.

The following example specifies a 40 pixels gap between the columns:

Example
div {
  column-gap: 40px;
}
CSS Column Rules
The column-rule-style property specifies the style of the rule between columns:

Example
div {
  column-rule-style: solid;
}
The column-rule-width property specifies the width of the rule between columns:

Example
div {
  column-rule-width: 1px;
}
The column-rule-color property specifies the color of the rule between columns:

Example
div {
  column-rule-color: lightblue;
}
The column-rule property is a shorthand property for setting all the column-rule-* properties above.

The following example sets the width, style, and color of the rule between columns:

Example
div {
  column-rule: 1px solid lightblue;
}
Specify How Many Columns an Element Should Span
The column-span property specifies how many columns an element should span across.

The following example specifies that the <h2> element should span across all columns:

Example
h2 {
  column-span: all;
}
Specify The Column Width
The column-width property specifies a suggested, optimal width for the columns.

The following example specifies that the suggested, optimal width for the columns should be 100px:

Example
div {
  column-width: 100px;
}
CSS Multi-columns Properties
The following table lists all the multi-columns properties: 

Property	Description
column-count	Specifies the number of columns an element should be divided into
column-fill	Specifies how to fill columns
column-gap	Specifies the gap between the columns
column-rule	A shorthand property for setting all the column-rule-* properties
column-rule-color	Specifies the color of the rule between columns
column-rule-style	Specifies the style of the rule between columns

                                                  CSS User Interface

CSS User Interface
In this chapter you will learn about the following CSS user interface properties:

resize
outline-offset
Browser Support
The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the property.

Property					
resize	4.0	79.0	5.0	4.0	15.0
outline-offset	4.0	15.0	5.0	4.0	9.5
CSS Resizing
The resize property specifies if (and how) an element should be resizable by the user.

This div element is resizable by the user!

To resize: Click and drag the bottom right corner of this div element.

The following example lets the user resize only the width of a <div> element:

Example
div {
  resize: horizontal;
  overflow: auto;
}
The following example lets the user resize only the height of a <div> element:

Example
div {
  resize: vertical;
  overflow: auto;
}
The following example lets the user resize both the height and width of a <div> element:

Example
div {
  resize: both;
  overflow: auto;
}
In many browsers, <textarea> is resizable by default. Here, we have used the resize property to disable the resizability:

Example
textarea {
  resize: none;
}
ADVERTISEMENT

CSS Outline Offset
The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge or border of an element.

This div has an outline 15px outside the border edge.
Note: Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

The following example uses the outline-offset property to add space between the border and the outline:

Example
div.ex1 {
  margin: 20px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  outline: 4px solid red;
  outline-offset: 15px;
}

div.ex2 {
  margin: 10px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  outline: 5px dashed blue;
  outline-offset: 5px;
}
CSS User Interface Properties
The following table lists all the user interface properties:

Property	Description
outline-offset	Adds space between an outline and the edge or border of an element
resize	Specifies whether or not an element is resizable by the user

                                              CSS Variables - The var() Function

CSS Variables
The var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.

CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can create variables with local or global scope, change the variables with JavaScript, and change the variables based on media queries.

A good way to use CSS variables is when it comes to the colors of your design. Instead of copy and paste the same colors over and over again, you can place them in variables.

The Traditional Way
The following example shows the traditional way of defining some colors in a style sheet (by defining the colors to use, for each specific element):

Example
body { background-color: #1e90ff; }

h2 { border-bottom: 2px solid #1e90ff; }

.container {
  color: #1e90ff;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  padding: 15px;
}

button {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  color: #1e90ff;
  border: 1px solid #1e90ff;
  padding: 5px;
}

Syntax of the var() Function
The var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.

The syntax of the var() function is as follows:

var(--name, value)
Value	Description
name	Required. The variable name (must start with two dashes)
value	Optional. The fallback value (used if the variable is not found)
Note: The variable name must begin with two dashes (--) and it is case sensitive!

How var() Works
First of all: CSS variables can have a global or local scope.

Global variables can be accessed/used through the entire document, while local variables can be used only inside the selector where it is declared.

To create a variable with global scope, declare it inside the :root selector. The :root selector matches the document's root element.

To create a variable with local scope, declare it inside the selector that is going to use it.

The following example is equal to the example above, but here we use the var() function.

First, we declare two global variables (--blue and --white). Then, we use the var() function to insert the value of the variables later in the style sheet:

Example
:root {
  --blue: #1e90ff;
  --white: #ffffff;
}

body { background-color: var(--blue); }

h2 { border-bottom: 2px solid var(--blue); }

.container {
  color: var(--blue);
  background-color: var(--white);
  padding: 15px;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--white);
  color: var(--blue);
  border: 1px solid var(--blue);
  padding: 5px;
}

Advantages of using var() are:

makes the code easier to read (more understandable)
makes it much easier to change the color values
To change the blue and white color to a softer blue and white, you just need to change the two variable values:

Example
:root {
  --blue: #6495ed;
  --white: #faf0e6;
}

body { background-color: var(--blue); }

h2 { border-bottom: 2px solid var(--blue); }

.container {
  color: var(--blue);
  background-color: var(--white);
  padding: 15px;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--white);
  color: var(--blue);
  border: 1px solid var(--blue);
  padding: 5px;
}

Browser Support
The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the var() function.

                                                    CSS Overriding Variables

Override Global Variable With Local Variable
From the previous page we have learned that global variables can be accessed/used through the entire document, while local variables can be used only inside the selector where it is declared.

Look at the example from the previous page:

Example
:root {
  --blue: #1e90ff;
  --white: #ffffff;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--blue);
}

h2 {
  border-bottom: 2px solid var(--blue);
}

.container {
  color: var(--blue);
  background-color: var(--white);
  padding: 15px;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--white);
  color: var(--blue);
  border: 1px solid var(--blue);
  padding: 5px;
}

Sometimes we want the variables to change only in a specific section of the page.

Assume we want a different color of blue for button elements. Then, we can re-declare the --blue variable inside the button selector. When we use var(--blue) inside this selector, it will use the local --blue variable value declared here.

We see that the local --blue variable will override the global --blue variable for the button elements:

Example
:root {
  --blue: #1e90ff;
  --white: #ffffff;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--blue);
}

h2 {
  border-bottom: 2px solid var(--blue);
}

.container {
  color: var(--blue);
  background-color: var(--white);
  padding: 15px;
}

button {
  --blue: #0000ff; /* local variable will override global */
  background-color: var(--white);
  color: var(--blue);
  border: 1px solid var(--blue);
  padding: 5px;
}

Add a New Local Variable
If a variable is to be used at only one single place, we could also have declared a new local variable, like this:

Example
:root {
  --blue: #1e90ff;
  --white: #ffffff;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--blue);
}

h2 {
  border-bottom: 2px solid var(--blue);
}

.container {
  color: var(--blue);
  background-color: var(--white);
  padding: 15px;
}

button {
  --button-blue: #0000ff; /* new local variable */
  background-color: var(--white);
  color: var(--button-blue);
  border: 1px solid var(--button-blue);
  padding: 5px;
}

                                                  CSS Change Variables With JavaScript

Change Variables With JavaScript
CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can change them with JavaScript.

Here is an example of how you can create a script to display and change the --blue variable from the example used in the previous pages. For now, do not worry if you are not familiar with JavaScript. You can learn more about JavaScript in our JavaScript Tutorial:

Example
<script>
// Get the root element
var r = document.querySelector(':root');

// Create a function for getting a variable value
function myFunction_get() {
  // Get the styles (properties and values) for the root
  var rs = getComputedStyle(r);
  // Alert the value of the --blue variable
  alert("The value of --blue is: " + rs.getPropertyValue('--blue'));
}

// Create a function for setting a variable value
function myFunction_set() {
  // Set the value of variable --blue to another value (in this case "lightblue")
  r.style.setProperty('--blue', 'lightblue');
}
</script>

                                                    CSS Using Variables in Media Queries

Using Variables in Media Queries
Now we want to change a variable value inside a media query.

Tip: Media Queries are about defining different style rules for different devices (screens, tablets, mobile phones, etc.). You can learn more Media Queries in our Media Queries Chapter.

Here, we first declare a new local variable named --fontsize for the .container class. We set its value to 25 pixels. Then we use it in the .container class further down. Then, we create a @media rule that says "When the browser's width is 450px or wider, change the --fontsize variable value of the .container class to 50px."

Here is the complete example:

Example
/* Variable declarations */
:root {
  --blue: #1e90ff;
  --white: #ffffff;
}

.container {
  --fontsize: 25px;
}

/* Styles */
body {
  background-color: var(--blue);
}

h2 {
  border-bottom: 2px solid var(--blue);
}

.container {
  color: var(--blue);
  background-color: var(--white);
  padding: 15px;
  font-size: var(--fontsize);
}

@media screen and (min-width: 450px) {
  .container {
    --fontsize: 50px;
  }
}

Here is another example where we also change the value of the --blue variable in the @media rule:

Example
/* Variable declarations */
:root {
  --blue: #1e90ff;
  --white: #ffffff;
}

.container {
  --fontsize: 25px;
}

/* Styles */
body {
  background-color: var(--blue);
}

h2 {
  border-bottom: 2px solid var(--blue);
}

.container {
  color: var(--blue);
  background-color: var(--white);
  padding: 15px;
  font-size: var(--fontsize);
}

@media screen and (min-width: 450px) {
  .container {
    --fontsize: 50px;
  }
   :root {
    --blue: lightblue;
  }
}

                                                  CSS Box Sizing

CSS Box Sizing
The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

Without the CSS box-sizing Property
By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:

width + padding + border = actual width of an element
height + padding + border = actual height of an element

This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appears bigger than you have set (because the element's border and padding are added to the element's specified width/height).

The following illustration shows two <div> elements with the same specified width and height:

This div is smaller (width is 300px and height is 100px).

This div is bigger (width is also 300px and height is 100px).

The two <div> elements above end up with different sizes in the result (because div2 has a padding specified):

Example
.div1 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
}

.div2 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 50px;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
The box-sizing property solves this problem.

ADVERTISEMENT

With the CSS box-sizing Property
The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height:

Both divs are the same size now!

Hooray!

Here is the same example as above, with box-sizing: border-box; added to both <div> elements:

Example
.div1 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.div2 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 50px;
  border: 1px solid red;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
Since the result of using the box-sizing: border-box; is so much better, many developers want all elements on their pages to work this way.

The code below ensures that all elements are sized in this more intuitive way. Many browsers already use box-sizing: border-box; for many form elements (but not all - which is why inputs and text areas look different at width: 100%;).

Applying this to all elements is safe and wise:

Example
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
CSS Box Sizing Property
Property	Description
box-sizing	Defines how the width and height of an element are calculated: should they include padding and borders, or not

                                                      CSS Media Queries

CSS2 Introduced Media Types
The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.

Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.

Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.

CSS3 Introduced Media Queries
Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

width and height of the viewport
width and height of the device
orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).

Browser Support
The numbers in the table specifies the first browser version that fully supports the @media rule.

Property					
@media	21.0	9.0	3.5	4.0	9.0
Media Query Syntax
A media query consists of a media type and can contain one or more expressions, which resolve to either true or false.

@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
  CSS-Code;
}
The result of the query is true if the specified media type matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all expressions in the media query are true. When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules.

Unless you use the not or only operators, the media type is optional and the all type will be implied.

You can also have different stylesheets for different media:

<link rel="stylesheet" media="mediatype and|not|only (expressions)" href="print.css">
ADVERTISEMENT

CSS3 Media Types
Value	Description
all	Used for all media type devices
print	Used for printers
screen	Used for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.
speech	Used for screenreaders that "reads" the page out loud
Media Queries Simple Examples
One way to use media queries is to have an alternate CSS section right inside your style sheet.

The following example changes the background-color to lightgreen if the viewport is 480 pixels wide or wider (if the viewport is less than 480 pixels, the background-color will be pink):

Example
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}
The following example shows a menu that will float to the left of the page if the viewport is 480 pixels wide or wider (if the viewport is less than 480 pixels, the menu will be on top of the content):

Example
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
  #leftsidebar {width: 200px; float: left;}
  #main {margin-left: 216px;}
}

                                                CSS Media Queries - Examples

CSS Media Queries - More Examples
Let us look at some more examples of using media queries.

Media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to different devices. To demonstrate a simple example, we can change the background color for different devices:


Example
/* Set the background color of body to tan */
body {
  background-color: tan;
}

/* On screens that are 992px or less, set the background color to blue */
@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
  body {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}

/* On screens that are 600px or less, set the background color to olive */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: olive;
  }
}
Do you wonder why we use exactly 992px and 600px? They are what we call "typical breakpoints" for devices. You can read more about typical breakpoints in our Responsive Web Design Tutorial.

Media Queries For Menus
In this example, we use media queries to create a responsive navigation menu, that varies in design on different screen sizes.

Large screens:

Small screens:

Example
/* The navbar container */
.topnav {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #333;
}

/* Navbar links */
.topnav a {
  float: left;
  display: block;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 14px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* On screens that are 600px wide or less, make the menu links stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .topnav a {
    float: none;
    width: 100%;
  }
}

Media Queries For Columns
A common use of media queries, is to create a flexible layout. In this example, we create a layout that varies between four, two and full-width columns, depending on different screen sizes:

Large screens:

Medium screens:

Small screens:

Example
/* Create four equal columns that floats next to each other */
.column {
  float: left;
  width: 25%;
}

/* On screens that are 992px wide or less, go from four columns to two columns */
@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
  .column {
    width: 50%;
  }
}

/* On screens that are 600px wide or less, make the columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .column {
    width: 100%;
  }
}

CSS Flexbox Layout Module
Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

Block, for sections in a webpage
Inline, for text
Table, for two-dimensional table data
Positioned, for explicit position of an element
The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

Browser Support
The flexbox properties are supported in all modern browsers.

29.0	11.0	22.0	10	48
Flexbox Elements
To start using the Flexbox model, you need to first define a flex container.

3
The element above represents a flex container (the blue area) with three flex items.

Example
A flex container with three flex items:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
</div>

                                                      CSS Flex Container

Parent Element (Container)
Like we specified in the previous chapter, this is a flex container (the blue area) with three flex items:

1
2
3
The flex container becomes flexible by setting the display property to flex:

Example
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
}
The flex container properties are:

flex-direction
flex-wrap
flex-flow
justify-content
align-items
align-content
ADVERTISEMENT

The flex-direction Property
The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.

1
2
3
Example
The column value stacks the flex items vertically (from top to bottom):

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

Example
The column-reverse value stacks the flex items vertically (but from bottom to top):

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}

Example
The row value stacks the flex items horizontally (from left to right):

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

Example
The row-reverse value stacks the flex items horizontally (but from right to left):

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
}

The flex-wrap Property
The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.

The examples below have 12 flex items, to better demonstrate the flex-wrap property.

Example
The wrap value specifies that the flex items will wrap if necessary:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

Example
The nowrap value specifies that the flex items will not wrap (this is default):

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
}

Example
The wrap-reverse value specifies that the flexible items will wrap if necessary, in reverse order:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
}

The flex-flow Property
The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

Example
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
}

The justify-content Property
The justify-content property is used to align the flex items:

1
2
3
Example
The center value aligns the flex items at the center of the container:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

Example
The flex-start value aligns the flex items at the beginning of the container (this is default):

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-start;
}

Example
The flex-end value aligns the flex items at the end of the container:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
}

Example
The space-around value displays the flex items with space before, between, and after the lines:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

Example
The space-between value displays the flex items with space between the lines:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

The align-items Property
The align-items property is used to align the flex items.

In these examples we use a 200 pixels high container, to better demonstrate the align-items property.

Example
The center value aligns the flex items in the middle of the container:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 200px;
  align-items: center;
}

Example
The flex-start value aligns the flex items at the top of the container:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 200px;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

Example
The flex-end value aligns the flex items at the bottom of the container:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 200px;
  align-items: flex-end;
}

Example
The stretch value stretches the flex items to fill the container (this is default):

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 200px;
  align-items: stretch;
}

Example
The baseline value aligns the flex items such as their baselines aligns:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 200px;
  align-items: baseline;
}
Note: the example uses different font-size to demonstrate that the items gets aligned by the text baseline:

The align-content Property
The align-content property is used to align the flex lines.

In these examples we use a 600 pixels high container, with the flex-wrap property set to wrap, to better demonstrate the align-content property.

Example
The space-between value displays the flex lines with equal space between them:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 600px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: space-between;
}

Example
The space-around value displays the flex lines with space before, between, and after them:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 600px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: space-around;
}

Example
The stretch value stretches the flex lines to take up the remaining space (this is default):

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 600px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: stretch;
}

Example
The center value displays display the flex lines in the middle of the container:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 600px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: center;
}

Example
The flex-start value displays the flex lines at the start of the container:

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 600px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: flex-start;
}

Example
The flex-end value displays the flex lines at the end of the container: 

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 600px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: flex-end;
}

Perfect Centering
In the following example we will solve a very common style problem: perfect centering.

SOLUTION: Set both the justify-content and align-items properties to center, and the flex item will be perfectly centered:

Example
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 300px;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

The CSS Flexbox Container Properties
The following table lists all the CSS Flexbox Container properties:

Property	Description
align-content	Modifies the behavior of the flex-wrap property. It is similar to align-items, but instead of aligning flex items, it aligns flex lines
align-items	Vertically aligns the flex items when the items do not use all available space on the cross-axis
display	Specifies the type of box used for an HTML element
flex-direction	Specifies the direction of the flexible items inside a flex container
flex-flow	A shorthand property for flex-direction and flex-wrap
flex-wrap	Specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not, if there is not enough room for them on one flex line
justify-content	Horizontally aligns the flex items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis

                                                          CSS Flex Items

Child Elements (Items)
The direct child elements of a flex container automatically becomes flexible (flex) items.

The element above represents four blue flex items inside a grey flex container.

Example
<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
  <div>4</div>
</div>

The flex item properties are:

order
flex-grow
flex-shrink
flex-basis
flex
align-self
The order Property
The order property specifies the order of the flex items.

1
2
3
4
The first flex item in the code does not have to appear as the first item in the layout.

The order value must be a number, default value is 0.

Example
The order property can change the order of the flex items:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div style="order: 3">1</div>
  <div style="order: 2">2</div>
  <div style="order: 4">3</div>
  <div style="order: 1">4</div>
</div>

The flex-grow Property
The flex-grow property specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items.

1
2
3
The value must be a number, default value is 0.

Example
Make the third flex item grow eight times faster than the other flex items:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div style="flex-grow: 1">1</div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 1">2</div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 8">3</div>
</div>

The flex-shrink Property
The flex-shrink property specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items.

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
The value must be a number, default value is 1.

Example
Do not let the third flex item shrink as much as the other flex items:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div style="flex-shrink: 0">3</div>
  <div>4</div>
  <div>5</div>
  <div>6</div>
  <div>7</div>
  <div>8</div>
  <div>9</div>
  <div>10</div>
</div>

The flex-basis Property
The flex-basis property specifies the initial length of a flex item.

1
2
3
4
Example
Set the initial length of the third flex item to 200 pixels:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div style="flex-basis: 200px">3</div>
  <div>4</div>
</div>

The flex Property
The flex property is a shorthand property for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties.

Example
Make the third flex item not growable (0), not shrinkable (0), and with an initial length of 200 pixels:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div style="flex: 0 0 200px">3</div>
  <div>4</div>
</div>

The align-self Property
The align-self property specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container.

The align-self property overrides the default alignment set by the container's align-items property.

1
2

In these examples we use a 200 pixels high container, to better demonstrate the align-self property:

Example
Align the third flex item in the middle of the container:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div style="align-self: center">3</div>
  <div>4</div>
</div>

Example
Align the second flex item at the top of the container, and the third flex item at the bottom of the container:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div style="align-self: flex-start">2</div>
  <div style="align-self: flex-end">3</div>
  <div>4</div>
</div>

The CSS Flexbox Items Properties
The following table lists all the CSS Flexbox Items properties:

Property	Description
align-self	Specifies the alignment for a flex item (overrides the flex container's align-items property)
flex	A shorthand property for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and the flex-basis properties
flex-basis	Specifies the initial length of a flex item
flex-grow	Specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items inside the same container
flex-shrink	Specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items inside the same container
order	Specifies the order of the flex items inside the same container

                                                        CSS Flex Responsive

Responsive Flexbox
You learned from the CSS Media Queries chapter that you can use media queries to create different layouts for different screen sizes and devices.

Laptop and Desktops:

1
2
3
Mobile phones and Tablets:

1
2
3

For example, if you want to create a two-column layout for most screen sizes, and a one-column layout for small screen sizes (such as phones and tablets), you can change the flex-direction from row to column at a specific breakpoint (800px in the example below):

Example
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

/* Responsive layout - makes a one column layout instead of a two-column layout */
@media (max-width: 800px) {
  .flex-container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}

Another way is to change the percentage of the flex property of the flex items to create different layouts for different screen sizes. Note that we also have to include flex-wrap: wrap; on the flex container for this example to work:

Example
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.flex-item-left {
  flex: 50%;
}

.flex-item-right {
  flex: 50%;
}

/* Responsive layout - makes a one column layout instead of a two-column layout */
@media (max-width: 800px) {
  .flex-item-right, .flex-item-left {
    flex: 100%;
  }
}

                                      Responsive Web Design - Introduction

What is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.

Responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS.

Responsive web design is not a program or a JavaScript.

Designing For The Best Experience For All Users
Web pages can be viewed using many different devices: desktops, tablets, and phones. Your web page should look good, and be easy to use, regardless of the device.

Web pages should not leave out information to fit smaller devices, but rather adapt its content to fit any device:



Desktop
Tablet
Phone
It is called responsive web design when you use CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen.

                                              Responsive Web Design - The Viewport

What is The Viewport?
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.

Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.

This was not perfect!! But a quick fix.

Setting The Viewport
HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.

You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:




Without the viewport meta tag



With the viewport meta tag

Tip: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links above to see the difference.

Size Content to The Viewport
Users are used to scroll websites vertically on both desktop and mobile devices - but not horizontally!

So, if the user is forced to scroll horizontally, or zoom out, to see the whole web page it results in a poor user experience.

Some additional rules to follow:

1. Do NOT use large fixed width elements - For example, if an image is displayed at a width wider than the viewport it can cause the viewport to scroll horizontally. Remember to adjust this content to fit within the width of the viewport.

2. Do NOT let the content rely on a particular viewport width to render well - Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary widely between devices, content should not rely on a particular viewport width to render well.

3. Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and large screens - Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements will cause the element to be too wide for the viewport on a smaller device. Instead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be careful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to fall outside the viewport on small devices.

                                                      Responsive Web Design - Grid-View

What is a Grid-View?
Many web pages are based on a grid-view, which means that the page is divided into columns:


Using a grid-view is very helpful when designing web pages. It makes it easier to place elements on the page.


A responsive grid-view often has 12 columns, and has a total width of 100%, and will shrink and expand as you resize the browser window.

Building a Responsive Grid-View
Lets start building a responsive grid-view.

First ensure that all HTML elements have the box-sizing property set to border-box. This makes sure that the padding and border are included in the total width and height of the elements.

Add the following code in your CSS:

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
Read more about the box-sizing property in our CSS Box Sizing chapter.

The following example shows a simple responsive web page, with two columns:

25%75%
Example
.menu {
  width: 25%;
  float: left;
}
.main {
  width: 75%;
  float: left;
}
The example above is fine if the web page only contains two columns.

However, we want to use a responsive grid-view with 12 columns, to have more control over the web page.

First we must calculate the percentage for one column: 100% / 12 columns = 8.33%.

Then we make one class for each of the 12 columns, class="col-" and a number defining how many columns the section should span:

CSS:
.col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
.col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
.col-3 {width: 25%;}
.col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
.col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
.col-6 {width: 50%;}
.col-7 {width: 58.33%;}
.col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
.col-9 {width: 75%;}
.col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
.col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
.col-12 {width: 100%;}
 All these columns should be floating to the left, and have a padding of 15px:

CSS:
[class*="col-"] {
  float: left;
  padding: 15px;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
Each row should be wrapped in a <div>. The number of columns inside a row should always add up to 12:

HTML:
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-3">...</div> <!-- 25% -->
  <div class="col-9">...</div> <!-- 75% -->
</div>
The columns inside a row are all floating to the left, and are therefore taken out of the flow of the page, and other elements will be placed as if the columns do not exist. To prevent this, we will add a style that clears the flow:

CSS:
.row::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}
We also want to add some styles and colors to make it look better:

Example
html {
  font-family: "Lucida Sans", sans-serif;
}

.header {
  background-color: #9933cc;
  color: #ffffff;
  padding: 15px;
}

.menu ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.menu li {
  padding: 8px;
  margin-bottom: 7px;
  background-color :#33b5e5;
  color: #ffffff;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.24);
}

.menu li:hover {
  background-color: #0099cc;
}
Notice that the webpage in the example does not look good when you resize the browser window to a very small width. In the next chapter you will learn how to fix that.

                                                    Responsive Web Design - Media Queries

What is a Media Query?
Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.

It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

Example
If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue:

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
Add a Breakpoint
Earlier in this tutorial we made a web page with rows and columns, and it was responsive, but it did not look good on a small screen.

Media queries can help with that. We can add a breakpoint where certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.


Desktop
Phone
Use a media query to add a breakpoint at 768px:

Example
When the screen (browser window) gets smaller than 768px, each column should have a width of 100%:

/* For desktop: */
.col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
.col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
.col-3 {width: 25%;}
.col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
.col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
.col-6 {width: 50%;}
.col-7 {width: 58.33%;}
.col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
.col-9 {width: 75%;}
.col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
.col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
.col-12 {width: 100%;}

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* For mobile phones: */
  [class*="col-"] {
    width: 100%;
  }
}

Always Design for Mobile First
Mobile First means designing for mobile before designing for desktop or any other device (This will make the page display faster on smaller devices).

This means that we must make some changes in our CSS.

Instead of changing styles when the width gets smaller than 768px, we should change the design when the width gets larger than 768px. This will make our design Mobile First:

Example
/* For mobile phones: */
[class*="col-"] {
  width: 100%;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* For desktop: */
  .col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
  .col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
  .col-3 {width: 25%;}
  .col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
  .col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
  .col-6 {width: 50%;}
  .col-7 {width: 58.33%;}
  .col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
  .col-9 {width: 75%;}
  .col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
  .col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
  .col-12 {width: 100%;}
}
Another Breakpoint
You can add as many breakpoints as you like.

We will also insert a breakpoint between tablets and mobile phones.


Desktop
Tablet
Phone
We do this by adding one more media query (at 600px), and a set of new classes for devices larger than 600px (but smaller than 768px):

Example
Note that the two sets of classes are almost identical, the only difference is the name (col- and col-s-):

/* For mobile phones: */
[class*="col-"] {
  width: 100%;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  /* For tablets: */
  .col-s-1 {width: 8.33%;}
  .col-s-2 {width: 16.66%;}
  .col-s-3 {width: 25%;}
  .col-s-4 {width: 33.33%;}
  .col-s-5 {width: 41.66%;}
  .col-s-6 {width: 50%;}
  .col-s-7 {width: 58.33%;}
  .col-s-8 {width: 66.66%;}
  .col-s-9 {width: 75%;}
  .col-s-10 {width: 83.33%;}
  .col-s-11 {width: 91.66%;}
  .col-s-12 {width: 100%;}
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* For desktop: */
  .col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
  .col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
  .col-3 {width: 25%;}
  .col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
  .col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
  .col-6 {width: 50%;}
  .col-7 {width: 58.33%;}
  .col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
  .col-9 {width: 75%;}
  .col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
  .col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
  .col-12 {width: 100%;}
}
It might seem odd that we have two sets of identical classes, but it gives us the opportunity in HTML, to decide what will happen with the columns at each breakpoint:

HTML Example
For desktop:

The first and the third section will both span 3 columns each. The middle section will span 6 columns.

For tablets:

The first section will span 3 columns, the second will span 9, and the third section will be displayed below the first two sections, and it will span 12 columns:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-3 col-s-3">...</div>
  <div class="col-6 col-s-9">...</div>
  <div class="col-3 col-s-12">...</div>
</div>
Typical Device Breakpoints
There are tons of screens and devices with different heights and widths, so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device. To keep things simple you could target five groups:

Example
/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...}

/* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...}

/* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}

/* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...}

/* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...}
Orientation: Portrait / Landscape
Media queries can also be used to change layout of a page depending on the orientation of the browser.

You can have a set of CSS properties that will only apply when the browser window is wider than its height, a so called "Landscape" orientation:

Example
The web page will have a lightblue background if the orientation is in landscape mode:

@media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
Hide Elements With Media Queries
Another common use of media queries, is to hide elements on different screen sizes:

I will be hidden on small screens.
Example
/* If the screen size is 600px wide or less, hide the element */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  div.example {
    display: none;
  }
}
Change Font Size With Media Queries
You can also use media queries to change the font size of an element on different screen sizes:

Variable Font Size.
Example
/* If the screen size is 601px or more, set the font-size of <div> to 80px */
@media only screen and (min-width: 601px) {
  div.example {
    font-size: 80px;
  }
}

/* If the screen size is 600px or less, set the font-size of <div> to 30px */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  div.example {
    font-size: 30px;
  }
}
CSS @media Reference
For a full overview of all the media types and features/expressions, please look at the @media rule in our CSS reference.

                                                        Responsive Web Design - Images

Resize the browser window to see how the image scales to fit the page.

Using The width Property
If the width property is set to a percentage and the height property is set to "auto", the image will be responsive and scale up and down:

Example
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead.

Using The max-width Property
If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:

Example
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
Add an Image to The Example Web Page
Example
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

Background Images
Background images can also respond to resizing and scaling.

Here we will show three different methods:

1. If the background-size property is set to "contain", the background image will scale, and try to fit the content area. However, the image will keep its aspect ratio (the proportional relationship between the image's width and height):


Here is the CSS code:

Example
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url('img_flowers.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: contain;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
2. If the background-size property is set to "100% 100%", the background image will stretch to cover the entire content area:


Here is the CSS code:

Example
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url('img_flowers.jpg');
  background-size: 100% 100%;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
3. If the background-size property is set to "cover", the background image will scale to cover the entire content area. Notice that the "cover" value keeps the aspect ratio, and some part of the background image may be clipped:


Here is the CSS code:

Example
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url('img_flowers.jpg');
  background-size: cover;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
Different Images for Different Devices
A large image can be perfect on a big computer screen, but useless on a small device. Why load a large image when you have to scale it down anyway? To reduce the load, or for any other reasons, you can use media queries to display different images on different devices.

Here is one large image and one smaller image that will be displayed on different devices:



Example
/* For width smaller than 400px: */
body {
  background-image: url('img_smallflower.jpg');
}

/* For width 400px and larger: */
@media only screen and (min-width: 400px) {
  body {
    background-image: url('img_flowers.jpg');
  }
}
You can use the media query min-device-width, instead of min-width, which checks the device width, instead of the browser width. Then the image will not change when you resize the browser window:

Example
/* For devices smaller than 400px: */
body {
  background-image: url('img_smallflower.jpg');
}

/* For devices 400px and larger: */
@media only screen and (min-device-width: 400px) {
  body {
    background-image: url('img_flowers.jpg');
  }
}
The HTML <picture> Element
The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.

The most common use of the <picture> element will be for images used in responsive designs. Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.

The <picture> element works similar to the <video> and <audio> elements. You set up different sources, and the first source that fits the preferences is the one being used:

Example
<picture>
  <source srcset="img_smallflower.jpg" media="(max-width: 400px)">
  <source srcset="img_flowers.jpg">
  <img src="img_flowers.jpg" alt="Flowers">
</picture>
The srcset attribute is required, and defines the source of the image.

The media attribute is optional, and accepts the media queries you find in CSS @media rule.

You should also define an <img> element for browsers that do not support the <picture> element.

                                                    Responsive Web Design - Videos

Using The width Property
If the width property is set to 100%, the video player will be responsive and scale up and down:

Example
video {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
Notice that in the example above, the video player can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead.

Using The max-width Property
If the max-width property is set to 100%, the video player will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:

Example
video {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
Add a Video to the Example Web Page
We want to add a video in our example web page. The video will be resized to always take up all the available space:

Example
video {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

                                              Responsive Web Design - Frameworks

There are many free CSS Frameworks that offer Responsive Design.

Using W3.CSS
A great way to create a responsive design, is to use a responsive style sheet, like W3.CSS

Display Property
An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid.

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: inline-grid;
}

All direct children of the grid container automatically become grid items.

Grid Columns
The vertical lines of grid items are called columns.


Grid Rows
The horizontal lines of grid items are called rows.


Grid Gaps
The spaces between each column/row are called gaps.


You can adjust the gap size by using one of the following properties:

column-gap
row-gap
gap
Example
The column-gap property sets the gap between the columns:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  column-gap: 50px;
}

Example
The row-gap property sets the gap between the rows:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  row-gap: 50px;
}

Example
The gap property is a shorthand property for the row-gap and the column-gap properties:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  gap: 50px 100px;
}

Example
The gap property can also be used to set both the row gap and the column gap in one value:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  gap: 50px;
}

Grid Lines
The lines between columns are called column lines.

The lines between rows are called row lines.


Refer to line numbers when placing a grid item in a grid container:

Example
Place a grid item at column line 1, and let it end on column line 3:

.item1 {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: 3;
}

Example
Place a grid item at row line 1, and let it end on row line 3:

.item1 {
  grid-row-start: 1;
  grid-row-end: 3;
}

Grid Container
To make an HTML element behave as a grid container, you have to set the display property to grid or inline-grid.

Grid containers consist of grid items, placed inside columns and rows.

The grid-template-columns Property
The grid-template-columns property defines the number of columns in your grid layout, and it can define the width of each column.

The value is a space-separated-list, where each value defines the width of the respective column.

If you want your grid layout to contain 4 columns, specify the width of the 4 columns, or "auto" if all columns should have the same width.

Example
Make a grid with 4 columns:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto auto auto;
}

Note: If you have more than 4 items in a 4 columns grid, the grid will automatically add a new row to put the items in.

The grid-template-columns property can also be used to specify the size (width) of the columns.

Example
Set a size for the 4 columns:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 80px 200px auto 40px;
}

The grid-template-rows Property
The grid-template-rows property defines the height of each row.

Note: The grid's total width has to be less than the container's width for the justify-content property to have any effect.

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  justify-content: center;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  justify-content: start;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  justify-content: end;
}

The align-content Property
The align-content property is used to vertically align the whole grid inside the container.

  align-content: space-evenly;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  height: 400px;
  align-content: space-around;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  height: 400px;
  align-content: space-between;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  height: 400px;
  align-content: start;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  height: 400px;
  align-content: end;
}

Child Elements (Items)
A grid container contains grid items.

By default, a container has one grid item for each column, in each row, but you can style the grid items so that they will span multiple columns and/or rows.

The grid-column Property:
The grid-column property defines on which column(s) to place an item.

You define where the item will start, and where the item will end.

Note: The grid-column property is a shorthand property for the grid-column-start and the grid-column-end properties.

To place an item, you can refer to line numbers, or use the keyword "span" to define how many columns the item will span.

Example
Make "item1" start on column 1 and end before column 5:

.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / 5;
}

Example
Make "item1" start on column 1 and span 3 columns:

.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / span 3;
}

Example
Make "item2" start on column 2 and span 3 columns:

.item2 {
  grid-column: 2 / span 3;
}

The grid-row Property:
The grid-row property defines on which row to place an item.

You define where the item will start, and where the item will end.

To place an item, you can refer to line numbers, or use the keyword "span" to define how many rows the item will span:

Example
Make "item1" start on row-line 1 and end on row-line 4:

.item1 {
  grid-row: 1 / 4;
}

Example
Make "item1" start on row 1 and span 2 rows:

.item1 {
  grid-row: 1 / span 2;
}

The grid-area Property
The grid-area property can be used as a shorthand property for the grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end and the grid-column-end properties.

.item8 {
  grid-area: 1 / 2 / 5 / 6;
}

Example
Make "item8" start on row-line 2 and column-line 1, and span 2 rows and 3 columns:

.item8 {
  grid-area: 2 / 1 / span 2 / span 3;
}

Naming Grid Items
The grid-area property can also be used to assign names to grid items.

Header
Menu
Main
Right
Footer
Named grid items can be referred to by the grid-template-areas property of the grid container.

Example
Item1 gets the name "myArea" and spans all five columns in a five columns grid layout:

.item1 {
  grid-area: myArea;
}
.grid-container {
  grid-template-areas: 'myArea myArea myArea myArea myArea';
}

Each row is defined by apostrophes (' ')

The columns in each row is defined inside the apostrophes, separated by a space.

Note: A period sign represents a grid item with no name.

Example
Let "myArea" span two columns in a five columns grid layout (period signs represent items with no name):

.item1 {
  grid-area: myArea;
}
.grid-container {
  grid-template-areas: 'myArea myArea . . .';
}

To define two rows, define the column of the second row inside another set of apostrophes:

Example
Make "item1" span two columns and two rows:

.grid-container {
  grid-template-areas: 'myArea myArea . . .' 'myArea myArea . . .';
}

Example
Name all items, and make a ready-to-use webpage template:

.item1 { grid-area: header; }
.item2 { grid-area: menu; }
.item3 { grid-area: main; }
.item4 { grid-area: right; }
.item5 { grid-area: footer; }

.grid-container {
  grid-template-areas:
    'header header header header header header'
    'menu main main main right right'
    'menu footer footer footer footer footer';
}

The Order of the Items
The Grid Layout allows us to position the items anywhere we like.

The first item in the HTML code does not have to appear as the first item in the grid.

1
2
3
4
5
6
Example
.item1 { grid-area: 1 / 3 / 2 / 4; }
.item2 { grid-area: 2 / 3 / 3 / 4; }
.item3 { grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 2; }
.item4 { grid-area: 1 / 2 / 2 / 3; }
.item5 { grid-area: 2 / 1 / 3 / 2; }
.item6 { grid-area: 2 / 2 / 3 / 3; }

You can re-arrange the order for certain screen sizes, by using media queries:

Example
@media only screen and (max-width: 500px) {
  .item1 { grid-area: 1 / span 3 / 2 / 4; }
  .item2 { grid-area: 3 / 3 / 4 / 4; }
  .item3 { grid-area: 2 / 1 / 3 / 2; }
  .item4 { grid-area: 2 / 2 / span 2 / 3; }
  .item5 { grid-area: 3 / 1 / 4 / 2; }
  .item6 { grid-area: 2 / 3 / 3 / 4; }
}
